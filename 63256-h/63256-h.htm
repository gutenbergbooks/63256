  <h2 class='c011'>BEFORE I SAILED</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tokio</span>, Sept. 23rd</p>

<p class='c009'>My new page of life is dawning.</p>

<p class='c009'>A trip beyond the seas—Meriken Kenbutsu—it’s
not an ordinary event.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is verily the first event in our family history
that I could trace back for six centuries.</p>

<p class='c009'>My to-day’s dream of America—dream of a
butterfly sipping on golden dews—was rudely
broken by the artless chirrup of a hundred
sparrows in my garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chui, chui! Chui, chui, chui!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bad sparrows!</p>

<p class='c009'>My dream was silly but splendid.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dream is no dream without silliness which is
akin to poetry.</p>

<p class='c009'>If my dream ever comes true!</p>
<p class='c014'>24th—The song of gay children scattered
over the street had subsided. The harvest
moon shone like a yellow halo of “Nono
Sama.” All things in blessed Mitsuho No
Kuni—the smallest ant also—bathed in sweet
inspiring beams of beauty. The soft song that
is not to be heard but to be felt, was in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>’Twas a crime, I judged, to squander lazily
such a gracious graceful hour within doors.</p>

<p class='c009'>I and my maid strolled to the Konpira
shrine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her red stout fingers—like sweet potatoes—didn’t
appear so bad tonight, for the moon
beautified every ugliness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our Emperor should proclaim forbidding
woman to be out at any time except under
the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without beauty woman is nothing. Face
is the whole soul. I prefer death if I am not
given a pair of dark velvety eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a shame even woman must grow old!</p>

<p class='c009'>One stupid wrinkle on my face would be
enough to stun me.</p>

<p class='c009'>My pride is in my slim fingers of satin skin.</p>

<p class='c009'>I’ll carefully clean my roseate finger-nails
before I’ll land in America.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our wooden clogs sounded melodious, like
a rhythmic prayer unto the sky. Japs fit
themselves to play music even with footgear.
Every house with a lantern at its entrance
looked a shrine cherishing a thousand idols
within.</p>

<p class='c009'>I kneeled to the Konpira god.</p>

<p class='c009'>I didn’t exactly see how to address him,
being ignorant what sort of god he was.</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt thirsty when I reached home. Before
I pulled a bucket from the well, I peeped
down into it. The moonbeams were beautifully
stealing into the waters.</p>

<p class='c009'>My tortoise-shell comb from my head
dropped into the well.</p>

<p class='c009'>The waters from far down smiled, heartily
congratulating me on going to Amerikey.</p>
<p class='c014'>25th—I thought all day long how I’ll look
in ’Merican dress.</p>
<p class='c014'>26th—My shoes and six pairs of silk stockings
arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>How I hoped they were Nippon silk!</p>

<p class='c009'>One pair’s value is 4 yens.</p>

<p class='c009'>Extravagance! How dear!</p>

<p class='c009'>I hardly see any bit of reason against bare
feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, of course, it depends on how they are
shaped.</p>

<p class='c009'>A Japanese girl’s feet are a sweet little
piece. Their flatness and archlessness manifest
their pathetic womanliness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feet tell as much as palms.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have taken the same laborious care with
my feet as with my hands. Now they have
to retire into the heavy constrained shoes of
America.</p>

<p class='c009'>It’s not so bad, however, to slip one’s feet
into gorgeous silk like that.</p>

<p class='c009'>My shoes are of superior shape. They
have a small high heel.</p>

<p class='c009'>I’m glad they make me much taller.</p>

<p class='c009'>A bamboo I set some three Summers ago
cast its unusually melancholy shadow on the
round paper window of my room, and whispered,
“Sara! Sara! Sara!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It sounded to me like a pallid voice of
sayonara.</p>

<p class='c009'>(By the way, the profuse tips of my bamboo
are like the ostrich plumes of my new American
hat.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sayonara” never sounded before more
sad, more thrilling.</p>

<p class='c009'>My good-bye to “home sweet home” amid
the camellias and white chrysanthemums is
within ten days. The steamer “Belgic”
leaves Yokohama on the sixth of next month.
My beloved uncle is chaperon during my
American journey.</p>
<p class='c014'>27th—I scissored out the pictures from the
’Merican magazines.</p>

<p class='c009'>(The magazines were all tired-looking back
numbers. New ones are serviceable in their
own home. Forgotten old actors stray into
the villages for an inglorious tour. So it is
with the magazines. Only the useless numbers
come to Japan, I presume.)</p>

<p class='c009'>The pictures—Meriken is a country of
woman; that’s why, I fancy, the pictures are
chiefly of woman—showed me how to pick up
the long skirt. That one act is the whole
“business” of looking charming on the street.
I apprehend that the grace of American ladies
is in the serpentine curves of the figure, in the
narrow waist.</p>

<p class='c009'>Woman is the slave of beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>I applied my new corset to my body. I
pulled it so hard.</p>

<p class='c009'>It pained me.</p>
<p class='c014'>28th—My heart was a lark.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sang, but not in a trembling voice like a
lark, some slices of school song.</p>

<p class='c009'>I skipped around my garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>Because it occurred to me finally that I’ll
appear beautiful in my new costume.</p>

<p class='c009'>I smiled happily to the sunlight whose
autumnal yellow flakes—how yellow they
were!—fell upon my arm stretched to pluck a
chrysanthemum.</p>

<p class='c009'>I admit that my arm is brown.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it’s shapely.</p>
<p class='c014'>29th—English of America—sir, it is light,
unreserved and accessible—grew dear again.
My love of it returned like the glow in a brazier
that I had watched passionately, then left all
the Summer days, and to which I turned my
apologetic face with Winter’s approaching
steps.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oya, oya, my book of Longfellow under
the heavy coat of dust!</p>

<p class='c009'>I dusted the book with care and veneration
as I did a wee image of the Lord a month
ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>The same old gentle face of ’Merican poet—a poet
 need not always to sing, I assure
you, of tragic lamentation and of “far-beyond”—stared
at me from its frontispiece.
I wondered if he ever dreamed his volume
would be opened on the tiny brown palms of a
Japan girl. A sudden fancy came to me as if
he—the spirit of his picture—flung his critical
impressive eyes at my elaborate cue with
coral-headed pin, or upon my face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Am I not a lovely young lady?</p>

<p class='c009'>I had thrown Longfellow, many months
ago, on the top shelf where a grave spider
was encamping, and given every liberty to
that reticent, studious, silver-haired gentleman
Mr. Moth to tramp around the “Arcadie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Moth ran out without giving his own
“honourable” impression of the popular poet,
when I let the pages flutter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Large fatherly poet he is, but not unique.
Uniqueness, however, has become commonplace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poet of “plain” plainness is he—plainness
in thought and colour. Even his elegance is
plain enough.</p>

<p class='c009'>I must read Mr. Longfellow again as I
used a year ago reclining in the Spring
breeze,—“A Psalm of Life,” “The Village
Blacksmith,” and half a dozen snatches from
“Evangeline” or “The Song of Hiawatha”
at the least. That is not because I am his
devotee—I confess the poet of my taste isn’t
he—but only because he is a great idol of
American ladies, as I am often told, and I
may suffer the accusation of idiocy in America,
if I be not charming enough to quote
lines from his work.</p>
<p class='c014'>30th—Many a year I have prayed for
something more decent than a marriage offer.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wonder if the generous destiny that will
convey me to the illustrious country of “woman
first” isn’t the “something.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I am pleased to sail for Amerikey, being a
woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shall I have to become “naturalized” in
America?</p>

<p class='c009'>The Jap “gentleman”—who desires the
old barbarity—persists still in fancying that
girls are trading wares.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he shall come to understand what is
Love!</p>

<p class='c009'>Fie on him!</p>

<p class='c009'>I never felt more insulted than when I was
asked in marriage by one unknown to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>No Oriental man is qualified for civilisation,
I declare.</p>

<p class='c009'>Educate man, but—beg your pardon—not
the woman!</p>

<p class='c009'>Modern gyurls born in the enlightened
period of Meiji are endowed with quite a remarkable
soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>I act as I choose. I haven’t to wait for my
mamma’s approval to laugh when I incline to.</p>
<p class='c014'>Oct. 1st—I stole into the looking-glass—woman
loses almost her delight in life if without
it—for the last glimpse of my hair in
Japan style.</p>

<p class='c009'>Butterfly mode!</p>

<p class='c009'>I’ll miss it adorning my small head, while
I’m away from home.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have often thought that Japanese display
Oriental rhetoric—only oppressive rhetoric
that palsies the spirit—in hair dressing. Its
beauty isn’t animation.</p>

<p class='c009'>I longed for another new attraction on my
head.</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt sad, however, when I cut off all the
paper cords from my hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>I dreaded that the American method of
dressing the hair might change my head into
an absurd little thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>My lengthy hair languished over my
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>I laid me down on the bamboo porch in the
pensive shape of a mermaid fresh from the
sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sportive breezes frolicked with my
hair. They must be mischievous boys of the
air.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought the reason why Meriken coiffure
seemed savage and without art was mainly
because it prized more of natural beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Naturalness is the highest of all beauties.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sayo shikaraba!</p>

<p class='c009'>Let me learn the beauty of American freedom,
starting with my hair!</p>

<p class='c009'>Are you sure it’s not slovenliness?</p>

<p class='c009'>Woman’s slovenliness is only forgiven where
no gentleman is born.</p>
<p class='c014'>2nd—Occasional forgetfulness, I venture to
say, is one of woman’s charms.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I fear too many lapses in my case fill
the background.</p>

<p class='c009'>I amuse myself sometimes fancying whether
I shall forget my husband’s name (if I ever
have one).</p>

<p class='c009'>How shall I manage “shall” and “will”?
My memory of it is faded.</p>

<p class='c009'>I searched for a printed slip, “How to use
Shall and Will.” I pressed to explore even
the pantry after it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Afterward I recalled that Professor asserted
that Americans were not precise in grammar.
The affirmation of any professor isn’t weighty
enough. But my restlessness was cured
somehow.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>“This must be the age of Jap girls!” I
ejaculated.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was reading a paper on our bamboo land,
penned by Mr. Somebody.</p>

<p class='c009'>The style was inferior to Irving’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have read his gratifying “Sketch Book.”
I used to sleep holding it under my wooden
pillow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Woman feels happy to stretch her hand even
in dream, and touch something that belongs
to herself. “Sketch Book” was my child for
many, many months.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Somebody has lavished adoring words
over my sisters.</p>

<p class='c009'>Arigato! Thank heavens!</p>

<p class='c009'>If he didn’t declare, however, that “no
sensible musume will prefer a foreign raiment
to her kimono!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He failed to make of me a completely happy
nightingale.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shall I meet the Americans in our flapping
gown?</p>

<p class='c009'>I imagined myself hitting off a tune of “Karan
Coron” with clogs, in circumspect steps,
along Fifth Avenue of somewhere. The
throng swarmed around me. They tugged my
silken sleeves, which almost swept the ground,
and inquired, “How much a yard?” Then
they implored me to sing some Japanese ditty.</p>

<p class='c009'>I’ll not play any sensational rôle for any
price.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let me remain a homely lass, though I
express no craft in Meriken dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do I look shocking in a corset?</p>

<p class='c009'>“In Pekin you have to speak Makey Hey
Rah” is my belief.</p>
<p class='c014'>3rd—My hand has seldom lifted anything
weightier than a comb to adjust my hair flowing
down my neck.</p>

<p class='c009'>The “silver” knife (large and sharp enough
to fight the Russians) dropped and cracked a
bit of the rim of the big plate.</p>

<p class='c009'>My hand tired.</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle and I were seated at a round
table in a celebrated American restaurant, the
“Western Sea House.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was my first occasion to face an orderly
heavy Meriken table d’hote.</p>

<p class='c009'>Its fertile taste was oily, the oppressive
smell emetic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Must I make friends with it?</p>

<p class='c009'>I am afraid my small stomach is only fitted
for a bowl of rice and a few cuts of raw fish.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is nothing more light, more inviting,
than Japanese fare. It is like a sweet Summer
villa with many a sliding shoji from which you
smile into the breeze and sing to the stars.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lightness is my choice.</p>

<p class='c009'>When, I wondered, could I feel at home
with American food!</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle is a Meriken “toow.” He promised
to show me a heap of things in America.</p>

<p class='c009'>He is an 1884 Yale graduate. He occupies
the marked seat of the chief secretary of the
“Nippon Mining Company.” He has procured
leave for one year.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>What were the questionable-looking fragments
on the plate?</p>

<p class='c009'>Pieces with pock-marks!</p>

<p class='c009'>Cheese was their honourable name.</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle scared me by saying that some
“charming” worms resided in them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pooh, pooh!</p>

<p class='c009'>They emitted an annoying smell. You have
to empty the choicest box of tooth powder
after even the slightest intercourse with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>I dare not make their acquaintance—no, not
for a thousand yens.</p>

<p class='c009'>I took a few of them in my pocket papers
merely as a curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shall I hang them on the door, so that the
pest may not come near to our house?</p>

<p class='c009'>(Even the pest-devils stay away from it, you
see.)</p>
<p class='c014'>4th—The “Belgic” makes one day’s delay.
She will leave on the seventh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not one week?” I cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>I pray that I may sleep a few nights longer
in my home. I grow sadder, thinking of my
departure.</p>

<p class='c009'>My mother shouldn’t come to the Meriken
wharf. Her tears may easily stop my American
adventure.</p>

<p class='c009'>I and my maid went to our Buddhist
monastery.</p>

<p class='c009'>I offered my good-bye to the graves of my
grandparents. I decked them with elegant
bunches of chrysanthemums.</p>

<p class='c009'>When we turned our steps homeward the
snowy-eyebrowed monk—how unearthly he appeared!—begged
me not to forget my family’s
church while I am in America.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Christians are barbarians. They eat beef
at funerals,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>His voice was like a chant.</p>

<p class='c009'>The winds brought a gush of melancholy
evening prayer from the temple.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tolling of the monastery bell was tragic.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Goun! Goun! Goun!”</p>
<p class='c014'>5th—A “chin koro” barked after me.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Japanese little doggie doesn’t know
better. He has to encounter many a strange
thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tap of my shoes was a thrill to him.
The rustling of my silk skirt—such a volatile
sound—sounded an alarm to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was hurrying along the road home from
uncle’s in Meriken dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a new delight I felt to catch the peeping
tips of my shoes from under my trailing
koshi goromo.</p>

<p class='c009'>I forced my skirt to wave, coveting a more
satisfactory glance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Did I look a suspicious character?</p>

<p class='c009'>I was glad, it amused me to think the dog
regarded me as a foreign girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, how I wished to change me into a different
style! Change is so pleasing.</p>

<p class='c009'>My imitation was clever. It succeeded.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I entered my house my maid was dismayed
and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bikkuri shita! You terrified me. I took
you for an ijin from Meriken country.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ho, ho! O ho, ho, ho!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I passed gracefully (like a princess making
her triumphant exit in the fifth act) into my
chamber, leaving behind my happiest laughter
and shut myself up.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I confess that I earned the most delicious
moment I have had for a long time.</p>

<p class='c009'>I cannot surrender under the accusation that
Japs are <i>only</i> imitators, but I admit that we
Nippon daughters are suited to be mimics.</p>

<p class='c009'>Am I not gifted in the adroit art?</p>

<p class='c009'>Where’s Mr. Somebody who made himself
useful to warn the musumes?</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I began to rehearse the scene of my
first interview with a white lady at San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c009'>I opened Bartlett’s English Conversation
Book, and examined it to see if what I spoke
was correct.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sat on the writing table. Japanese houses
set no chairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>(Goodness, mottainai! I sat on the great
book of Confucius.)</p>

<p class='c009'>The mirror opposite me showed that I was
a “little dear.”</p>
<p class='c014'>6th—It rained.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soft, woolen Autumn rain like a gossamer!</p>

<p class='c009'>Its suggestive sound is a far-away song
which is half sob, half odor. The October
rain is sweet sad poetry.</p>

<p class='c009'>I slid open a paper door.</p>

<p class='c009'>My house sits on the hill commanding a
view over half Tokio and the Bay of Yedo.</p>

<p class='c009'>My darling city—with an eternal tea and
cake, with lanterns of festival—looked up to
me through the gray veil of rain.</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt as if Tokio were bidding me farewell.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sayonara! My dear city!</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>12th—The tossing spectacle of the waters
(also the hostile smell of the ship) put my
head in a whirl before the “Belgic” left the
wharf.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last five days have been a continuous
nightmare. How many a time would I have
preferred death!</p>

<p class='c009'>My little self wholly exhausted by sea-sickness.
Have I to drift to America in skin and
bone?</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt like a paper flag thrown in a tempest.</p>

<p class='c009'>The human being is a ridiculously small
piece. Nature plays with it and kills it when
she pleases.</p>

<p class='c009'>I cannot blame Balboa for his fancy,
because he caught his first view from the peak
in Darien.</p>

<p class='c009'>It’s not the “Pacific Ocean.” The breaker
of the world!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you feel any better?” inquired my
fellow passenger.</p>

<p class='c009'>He is the new minister to the City of
Mexico on his way to his post. My uncle is
one of his closest friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>What if Meriken ladies should mistake me
for the “sweet” wife of such a shabby pock-marked
gentleman?</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be all right, I thought, for we shall
part at San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c009'>(The pock-mark is rare in America, Uncle
said. No country has a special demand for
it, I suppose.)</p>

<p class='c009'>His boyish carelessness and samurai-fashioned
courtesy are characteristic. His
great laugh, “Ha, ha, ha!” echoes on half a
mile.</p>

<p class='c009'>He never leaves his wine glass alone. My
uncle complains of his empty stomach.</p>

<p class='c009'>The more the minister repeats his cup the
more his eloquence rises on the Chinese
question. He does not forget to keep up his
honourable standard of diplomatist even in
drinking, I fancy.</p>

<p class='c009'>I see charm in the eloquence of a drunkard.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>I exposed myself on deck for the first time.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wasn’t strong enough, alas! to face the
threatening grandeur of the ocean. Its
divineness struck and wounded me.</p>

<p class='c009'>O such an expanse of oily-looking waters!
O such a menacing largeness!</p>

<p class='c009'>One star, just one sad star, shone above.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought that the little star was trembling
alone on a deck of some ship in the sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>Star and I cried.</p>
<p class='c014'>13th—My first laughter on the ocean burst
out while I was peeping at a label, “7 yens,”
inside the chimney-pot hat of our respected
minister, when he was brushing it.</p>

<p class='c009'>He must have bought that great headgear
just on the eve of his appointment.</p>

<p class='c009'>How stupid to leave such a bit of paper!</p>

<p class='c009'>I laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>He asked what was so irresistibly funny.</p>

<p class='c009'>I laughed more. I hardly repressed “My
dear old man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The “helpless me” clinging on the bed for
many a day feels splendid to-day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ocean grew placid.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the land my eyes meet with a thousand
temptations. They are here opened for nothing
but the waters or the sun-rays.</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t gain any lesson, but I have learned
to appreciate the demonstrations of light.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were white. O what a heavenly
whiteness!</p>

<p class='c009'>The billows sang a grand slow song in blessing
of the sun, sparkling their ivory teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The voyage isn’t bad, is it?</p>

<p class='c009'>I planted myself on the open deck, facing
Japan.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am a mountain-worshipper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas! I could not see that imperial dome
of snow, Mount Fuji.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>One dozen fairies—two dozen—roved down
from the sky to the ocean.</p>

<p class='c009'>I dreamed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was so very happy.</p>
<p class='c014'>14th—What a confusion my hair has suffered!
I haven’t put it in order since I left the Orient.
Such negligence of toilet would be fined by
the police in Japan.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was busy with my hair all the morning.</p>
<p class='c014'>15th—The Sunday service was held.</p>

<p class='c009'>There’s nothing more natural on a voyage
than to pray.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have abandoned the land. The ocean
has no bottom.</p>

<p class='c009'>We die any moment “with bubbling groan,
without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and
unknown.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Only prayer makes us firm.</p>

<p class='c009'>I addressed myself to the Great Invisible
whose shadow lies across my heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>He may not be the God of Christianity.
He is not the Hotoke Sama of Buddhism.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why don’t those red-faced sailors hum
heavenly-voiced hymns instead of—“swear?”</p>
<p class='c014'>16th—Amerikey is away beyond.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not even a speck of San Francisco in sight
yet!</p>

<p class='c009'>I amused myself thinking what would happen
if I never returned home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Marriage with a ’Merican, wealthy and
comely?</p>

<p class='c009'>I had well-nigh decided that I would not
cross such an ocean again by ship. I would
wait patiently until a trans-Pacific railroad is
erected.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was basking in the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>I fancied the “Belgic” navigating a wrong
track.</p>

<p class='c009'>What then?</p>

<p class='c009'>Was I approaching lantern-eyed demons or
howling cannibals?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Iya, iya, no! I will proudly land on the
historical island of Lotos Eaters.” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why didn’t I take Homer with me? The
ocean is just the place for his majestic simplicity
and lofty swing.</p>

<p class='c009'>I recalled a few passages of “The Lotos
Eaters” by Lord Tennyson—it sounds better
than “the poet Tennyson.” I love titles, but
they are thought as common as millionaires
nowadays.</p>

<p class='c009'>A Jap poet has a different mode of speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shall I pose as poet?</p>

<p class='c009'>’Tis no great crime to do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>I began my “Lotos Eaters” with the following
mighty lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>

      <div class='line'>“O dreamy land of stealing shadows!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>O peace-breathing land of calm afternoon!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>O languid land of smile and lullaby!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>O land of fragrant bliss and flower!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>O eternal land of whispering Lotos Eaters!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Then I feared that some impertinent poet
might have said the same thing many a year
before.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poem manufacture is a slow job.</p>

<p class='c009'>Modern people slight it, calling it an old
fashion. Shall I give it up for some more
brilliant up-to-date pose?</p>
<p class='c014'>17th—I began to knit a gentleman’s stockings
in wool.</p>

<p class='c009'>They will be a souvenir of this voyage.</p>

<p class='c009'>(I cannot keep a secret.)</p>

<p class='c009'>I tell you frankly that I designed them to be
given to the gentleman who will be my future
“beloved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The wool is red, a symbol of my sanguine
attachment.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stockings cannot be much larger than
my own feet. I dislike large-footed gentlemen.</p>
<p class='c014'>18th—My uncle asked if my great work of
poetical inspiration was completed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle, I haven’t written a dozen lines yet.
My ‘Lotos Eaters’ is to be equal in length to
‘The Lady of the Lake.’ Now, see, Oji San,
mine has to be far superior to the laureate’s,
not merely in quality, but in quantity as well.
But I thought it was not the way of a sweet
Japanese girl to plunder a garland from the
old poet by writing in rivalry. Such a nice
man Tennyson was!” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I smiled and gazed on him slyly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So! You are very kind!” he jerked.</p>
<p class='c014'>19th—I don’t think San Francisco is very
far off now. Shall I step out of the ship and
walk?</p>

<p class='c009'>Has the “Belgic” coal enough? I wonder
how the sensible steamer can be so slow!</p>

<p class='c009'>Let the blank pages pass quickly! Let me
come face to face with the new chapter—“America!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gray monotone of life makes me
insane.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such an eternal absence of variety on the
ocean!</p>
<p class='c014'>20th—The moon—how large is the ocean
moon!—sat above my head.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I thought that that moon must have
been visiting in my dearest home of Tokio,
the tragic scene of my “Sayonara, mother!”
instantly returned.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tears on my cheeks!</p>
<p class='c014'>Morning, 21st—Three P.M. of to-day!</p>

<p class='c009'>At last!</p>

<p class='c009'>Beautiful Miss Morning Glory shall land on
her dream-land, Amerikey.</p>

<p class='c009'>That’s my humble name, sir.</p>

<p class='c009'>18 years old.</p>

<p class='c009'>(Why does the ’Merican lady regard it as
an insult to be asked her own age?)</p>

<p class='c009'>My knitting work wasn’t half done. I look
upon it as an omen that I shall have no luck
in meeting with my husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tsumaranai! What a barren life!</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>Our great minister was placing a button on
his shirt. His trembling fingers were uncertain.</p>

<p class='c009'>I snatched the shirt from his hand and
exhibited my craft with the needle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I fancied that you modern girls were
perfect strangers to the needle,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>He is not blockish, I thought, since he
permits himself to employ irony.</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle was lamenting that he had not
even one cigar left.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both those gentlemen offered to help me
in my dressing at the landing.</p>

<p class='c009'>I declined gracefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where is my looking-glass?</p>

<p class='c009'>I must present myself very—very pretty.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>IN AMERIKEY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>San Francisco</span>, night, 21st</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye, Mr. Belgic!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I delight in personifying everything as a
gentleman.</p>
<p class='c014'>What does it mean under the sun! Kitsune
ni tsukamareta wa! Evil fox, I suppose,
got hold of me. “Gentlemen, is this real
Amerikey?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oya, ma, my Meriken dream was a complete
failure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Did I ever fancy any sky-invading dragon
of smoke in my own America?</p>

<p class='c009'>The smoke stifled me.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why did I lock up my perfume bottle in
my trunk?</p>

<p class='c009'>I hardly endured the smell from the wagons
at the wharf. Their rattling noise thrust
itself into my head. A squad of Chinamen
there puffed incessantly the menacing smell of
cigars.</p>

<p class='c009'>Were I the mayor of San Francisco—how
romantic “the Mayor, Miss Morning Glory”
sounds!—I would not pause a moment before
erecting free bath-houses around the wharf.</p>

<p class='c009'>I never dreamed that human beings could
cast such an insulting smell.</p>

<p class='c009'>The smell of honourable wagon drivers is the
smell of a M-O-N-K-E-Y.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their wild faces also prove their likeness to
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>They must have furnished all the evidence
to Mr. Darwin. “The better part lies some
distance from here,” said my uncle.</p>

<p class='c009'>I exclaimed how inhospitable the Americans
were to receive visitors from the back door of
the city.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are not empty-stomached tramps rapping
the kitchen door for a crust of bread.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>We refused hotel carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>We walked from the Oriental wharf for the
sake of the street sight-seeing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tamageta wa! A house was whirling along
the street. Look at the horseless car! How
could it be possible to pull it with a rope under
ground!</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything reveals a huge scale of measurement.</p>

<p class='c009'>The continental spectacle is different from
that of our islands.</p>

<p class='c009'>We 40,000,000 Japs must raise our heads from
wee bits of land. There’s no room to stretch
elbows. We have to stay like dwarf trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>I shouldn’t be surprised if the Americans exclaim
in Japan, “What a petty show!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a riotous rush! What a deafening
uproar!</p>

<p class='c009'>The lazy halt of a moment on the street
must have been regarded, I fancied, as a violation
of the law.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wondered whether one dozen were not
slain each hour on Market Street by the cars.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cars! Cars! And cars!</p>

<p class='c009'>It was no use to look beautiful in such a
cyclone city. Not even one gentleman moved
his admiring eyes to my face.</p>

<p class='c009'>How sad!</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought it must be some festival.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, the usual Saturday throng!” my uncle
said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I asked myself whether Tokio streets
were only like a midnight of this city.</p>

<p class='c009'>My beloved minister kept his mouth open—what
heavy lips he had!—amazed at the high
edifices.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O ho, that’s astonishing!” he cried, throwing
his sottish eyes on the clock of the <i>Chronicle</i>
building.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boys are commenting on you,” I whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>I beseeched him not to act so droll.</p>

<p class='c009'>He tossed out in his careless fashion his
everlasting heroic laughter, “Ha, ha, ha——”</p>

<p class='c009'>A hawkish lad—I have not seen one sleepy
fellow yet—drew near the minister shortly after
we left the wharf, and begged to carry his bag.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was only too glad to be assisted. The
brown diplomatist thought it a loving deed
toward a foreigner.</p>

<p class='c009'>He bowed after some blocks, thanking the
boy with a hearty “arigato.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, you have to pay me two bits!”</p>

<p class='c009'>His hand went to his pocket, when my uncle
tapped his stooping back, speaking: “This is
the country of eternal ‘pay, pay, pay,’ old man!”</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>“What does a genuine American beggar
look like?” was my old question.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Meriken beggar my friend saw at
Yokohama park was dressed up in a swallow-tail
coat. Emerson’s essays were in his hand.
He was such a genteel Mr. Beggar, she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I often heard that everybody is a millionaire
in America. I thought it likely that I should
see a swell Mr. Beggar among the Americans.</p>

<p class='c009'>How many a time had I planned to make a
special trip to Yokohama for acquaintance with
the honourable Emerson scholar!</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas, it was merely a fancy!</p>

<p class='c009'>I have seen Mr. Beggar on the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>He didn’t appear in the formal dignity of a
dress coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where was his Emerson?</p>

<p class='c009'>He was not unlike his Oriental brothers,
after all.</p>

<p class='c009'>He stood, because he wasn’t used to kneeling
like the Japs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The only difference was that he carried
pencils instead of a musical instrument.</p>

<p class='c009'>He is a merchant,—this is a business
country,—while the Japanese Mr. Beggar is
an artist, I suppose.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>My little gold watch pointed eleven.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have been writing for some hours about my
first impression of the city from the wharf, and
my journey from there to this Palace Hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The number of my room is 489.</p>

<p class='c009'>I fear I may not return if I once go out.
It’s so hard to remember the number.</p>

<p class='c009'>The large mirror reflected me as being so
very small in the big room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a great room with high ceiling!</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t feel at home at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not a petal of flower. No inviting picture
on the wall!</p>

<p class='c009'>I was tired of hearing the artificial greeting,
“Irasshai mashi,” or “Honourable welcome,”
of the eternally bowing Japanese hotel attendants.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the too simple treatment of ’Merican
hotel is hardly to my taste.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not even one girl to wait on me here!</p>

<p class='c009'>No “honourable tea and cake.”</p>
<p class='c014'>22nd—I need repose. The last few weeks
have stirred me dreadfully. I will slumber
just comfortably day after day, I decided.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the same feeling as on the ocean returned.</p>

<p class='c009'>My American bed acted like water, waving
at even my slightest motion.</p>

<p class='c009'>I fancied I was exercising even in sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is too soft.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing can put me at complete ease like
my hereditary lying on the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was restless all the night long.</p>

<p class='c009'>I got up, since the bed was no joy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, the blue sky!</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought I should never again see a sapphire
sky while I am here. I was wrong.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is church day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bells of the street-cars sounded musical.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sky appeared in best Sunday dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt happy thinking that I should see the
stars from my hotel window to-night.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>I made many useless trips up and down the
elevator for fun.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a tickling dizziness I tasted!</p>

<p class='c009'>I close my eyes when it goes.</p>

<p class='c009'>It’s an awfully new thing, I reckon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Something on the same plan, I imagine, as
a “seriage” of the Japanese stage for a footless
ghost rising to vanish.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is astonishing to notice what a condescending
manner the white gentlemen display
toward ladies.</p>

<p class='c009'>They take off their hats in the elevator—some
showing such a great bald head, like a
funny O Binzuru, that is as common as spectacled
children—if any woman is present.
They stand humbly as Japs to the august
“Son of Heaven.” They crawl out like lambs
after the woman steps away.</p>

<p class='c009'>It puzzles me to solve how women can be
deserving of such honour.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a goody-goody act!</p>

<p class='c009'>But I wonder how they behave themselves
before God!</p>
<p class='c014'>23rd—It is delightful to sit opposite the
whitest of linen and—to portray on it the face
of an imaginary Mr. Sweetheart while eating.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whiteness is appetising.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the boldly-marked creases of the linen
are so dear. Without them the linen is not
half so inviting.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was taught the beauty of single line in
drawing class some years ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now for the first time I fully comprehended
it from the Meriken tablecloth.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wished I could ever stay gazing at it.</p>

<p class='c009'>If I start my housekeeping in this country—do
I ever dream of it?—I shall not hesitate to
invest all my money in linen.</p>

<p class='c009'>I laughed when I fancied that I sat with my
husband—where’s he in the world?—spreading
a skilfully ironed linen cloth on the Spring
grasses (what a gratifying white and green!),
and I upset a teapot over the linen, while he
ran after water;—then I picked all the buttercups
and covered the dark red stain.</p>

<p class='c009'>The minister makes a ridiculous show of
himself in the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>His laughter draws the attention of every
lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>This morning he exclaimed: “Americans
have no courtesy for strangers, except meaning
money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he finished his speech with his boisterous
“Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A pale impatient lady, like a trembling winter
leaf, sitting at the table next to us, shrugged
her shoulders and muttered, “Oh, my!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I hoped I could invent any scheme to make
him hasten to his post—Kara or Tenjiku,
whatever place it be.</p>

<p class='c009'>He is good-natured like a rubber stamp.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I am sorry to say that he does not fit
Amerikey.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was relieved when he announced that his
departure would occur to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>My dignity was saved.</p>

<p class='c009'>I cut a square piece of paper. I pencilled
on it as follows:</p>
<p class='c003'>&nbsp;</p>
<div class='box3'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>To the Japanese Legation.</div>
    <div>The City of Mexico.</div>
    <div>Handle Carefully, Easily Broken.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c014'>I put it on the large palm of the minister.
I warned him that he should never forget to
pin it on his breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mean little thing you are!” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>And his great happy “Ha, ha, ha!” followed
as usual.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bye-bye!</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>The negroes are horrid. I scanned them
on the first chance of my life.</p>

<p class='c009'>What is the standard of beauty of their
tribe, I am eager to be informed!</p>

<p class='c009'>I searched for “coon” in my dictionary.
The explanation was unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ever-so-kind Americans don’t consider
them, I am certain, as “animals allied to the
bear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tell me what it means.</p>
<p class='c014'>24th—Spittoon!</p>

<p class='c009'>The American spittoon is famous, Uncle
says.</p>

<p class='c009'>From every corner in this nine-story hotel—think
of its eight hundred and fifty-one
rooms!—you are met by the greeting of the
spittoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>How many thousand are there?</p>

<p class='c009'>It must be a tremendous task to keep them
clean as they are.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wonder why the proprietor doesn’t give
the city the benefit of some of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>San Francisco ought to place spittoons along
the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ladies wear such a long gaudy skirt.</p>

<p class='c009'>And it is quite a fashion of modern gents, it
appears, to spit on the pavements.</p>

<p class='c009'>This Palace Hotel is a palace.</p>

<p class='c009'>You drop into the toilet room, for instance.</p>

<p class='c009'>You cannot help exclaiming: “Iya, haya,
Japan is three centuries behind!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything presents to you a silent lecture
of scientific modernism.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whenever I am bothered too much by my
uncle I lock myself up in the toilet room. There
I feel the whole world is mine.</p>

<p class='c009'>I can take off my shoes. I can play acrobat
if I prefer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nobody can spy me.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is the place where you can pray or cry all
you desire without one interruption.</p>

<p class='c009'>My room is great, equipped with every new
invention. Numbers of electric globes dazzle
with kingly light above my head.</p>

<p class='c009'>If I enter my room at dusk, I push a button
of electricity.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a satisfaction I earn seeing every light
appear to my honourable service!</p>

<p class='c009'>I look upon my finger wondering how such
an Oriental little thing can make itself potent
like the mighty thumb of Mr. Edison.</p>
<p class='c014'>25th—What a novel sensation I felt in writing
“San Francisco, U.S.A.,” at the head of
my tablet!</p>

<p class='c009'>(What agitation I shall feel when I write
my first “Mrs.” before my name! Woman
must grow tired of being addressed “Miss,”
sooner or later.)</p>

<p class='c009'>I have often said that I hardly saw any
necessity for corresponding when one lives on
such a small island as Japan.</p>

<p class='c009'>I could see my friends in a day or two, at
whatever place I was.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have now the ocean between me and my
home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Letter writing is worth while.</p>

<p class='c009'>I did not know it was such a sweet piece of
work.</p>

<p class='c009'>I should declare it to be as legitimate and
inexpensive a game as ever woman could indulge
in.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>I was stepping along the courtyard of this
hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have seen a gentleman kissing a woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt my face catching fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is it not a shame in a public place?</p>

<p class='c009'>I returned to my apartment. The mirror
showed my cheeks still blushing.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>The Japanese consul and his Meriken
wife—she is some inches higher than her darling—paid
us a call.</p>

<p class='c009'>I said to myself that they did not match well.
It was like a hired haori with a different coat
of arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Consul looked proud, as if he carried a
crocodile.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Consul invited us for luncheon next
Sunday.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite a family party—O ho, ho!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her voice was unceremonious.</p>

<p class='c009'>I noticed that one of her hairpins was about
to drop. I thought that Meriken woman was
as careless as I.</p>

<p class='c009'>How many hairpins do you suppose I lost
yesterday?</p>

<p class='c009'>Four! Isn’t that awful?</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle innocently stated to her I was a
great belle of Tokio.</p>

<p class='c009'>I secretly pinched his arm through his coat-sleeve.
My little signal did not influence him
at all. He kept on his hyperbolical advertisement
of me.</p>

<p class='c009'>She promised a beautiful girl to meet me on
Sunday.</p>

<p class='c009'>I fancied how she looked.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought my performance of the first
interview with Meriken woman was excellent.
But my rehearsal at home was useless.</p>
<p class='c014'>26th—I lost my little charm.</p>

<p class='c009'>It worried me awfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was given me by my old-fashioned mother.
She got it after a holy journey of one month
to the shrine of Tenno Sama.</p>

<p class='c009'>I should be safe, Mother said, from water,
fire and highwayman (what else, God only
knows) as long as I should carry it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sought after it everywhere. I begged my
uncle to let me examine his trunk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cast off an ancient superstition!” Uncle
scorned.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sat languidly on the large armchair which
almost swallowed my small body.</p>

<p class='c009'>I imagined many a punishment already inflicted
on me.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tick-tack of my watch from my waist
encouraged my nervousness.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is nothing more irritating than a tick-tack.</p>

<p class='c009'>I locked up my watch in the drawer of the
dresser.</p>

<p class='c009'>I still felt its tick-tack pursuing my ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I put it under the pillow.</p>
<p class='c014'>27th—How I wished I could exchange a
ten-dollar gold-piece for a tassel of curly hair!</p>

<p class='c009'>American woman is nothing without it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Its infirm gesticulation is a temptation.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Japan I regarded it as bad luck to own
waving hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>But my tastes cannot remain unaltered in
Amerikey.</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t mind being covered with even red
hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red hair is vivacity, fit for Summer’s shiny air.</p>

<p class='c009'>I remember that I trembled at sight of the
red hair of an American woman at Tokio.
Japanese regard it as the hair of the red demon
in Jigoku.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sat before the looking-glass, with a pair
of curling-tongs.</p>

<p class='c009'>I tried to manage them with surprising patience.
I assure you God doesn’t vouchsafe
me much patience.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such disobedient tools!</p>

<p class='c009'>They didn’t work at all. I threw them on
the floor in indignation.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Drawn by Genjiro Yeto</i></span><br />“<span class='sc'>Such Disobedient Tools!</span>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>My wrists pained.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sat on the floor, stretching out my legs.
My shoe-strings were loosed, but my hand did
not hasten to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was exhausted with making my hair curl.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sent my uncle to fetch a hair-dresser.</p>
<p class='c014'>28th—How old is she?</p>

<p class='c009'>I could never suggest the age of a Meriken
woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>That Miss Ada was a beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>It’s becoming clearer to me now why California
puts so much pride in her own girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ada was a San Franciscan whom Mrs. Consul
presented to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>What was her family name?</p>

<p class='c009'>Never mind! It is an extra to remember it
for girls. We don’t use it.</p>

<p class='c009'>How envious I was of her long eyelashes
lacing around the large eyes of brown hue!</p>

<p class='c009'>Brown was my preference for the velvet
hanao of my wooden clogs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Long eyelashes are a grace, like the long
skirt.</p>

<p class='c009'>I know that she is a clever young thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was learned in the art of raising and
dropping her curtain of eyelashes. That is
the art of being enchanting. I had said that
nothing could beat the beauty of my black
eyes. But I see there are other pretty eyes
in this world.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything doesn’t grow in Japan. Noses
particularly.</p>

<p class='c009'>My sweet Ada’s nose was an inspiration,
like the snow-capped peak of O Fuji San. It
rose calmly—how symmetrically!—from between
her eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had thought that ’Merican nose was
rugged, big of bone.</p>

<p class='c009'>I see an exception in Ada.</p>

<p class='c009'>She must be the pattern of Meriken beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt that I was so very homely.</p>

<p class='c009'>I stole a sly glance into the looking-glass,
and convinced myself that I was a beauty also,
but Oriental.</p>

<p class='c009'>We had different attractions.</p>

<p class='c009'>She may be Spring white sunshine, while I
am yellow Autumn moonbeams. One is animation,
and the other sweetness.</p>

<p class='c009'>I smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>She smiled back promptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>We promised love in our little smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>She placed her hand on my shoulder. How
her diamond ring flashed! She praised the
satin skin of my face.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was very white, with a few sprinkles of
freckles. Their scattering added briskness to
the face in her case. (But doesn’t San Francisco
produce too many freckles in woman?)
The texture of Ada’s skin wasn’t fine. Her
face was like a ripe peach with powdery
hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is it true that dark skin is gaining popularity
in American society?</p>

<p class='c009'>The Japanese type of beauty is coming to
the front then, I am happy.</p>

<p class='c009'>I repaid her compliment, praising her elegant
set of teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ada is the free-born girl of modern
Amerikey.</p>

<p class='c009'>She need never fear to open her mouth wide.</p>

<p class='c009'>She must have been using special tooth-powder
three times a day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are great friends already, aren’t we?”
I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>And I extended my finger-tips behind her,
and pulled some wisps of her chestnut hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, don’t!” she said, and raised her
sweetly accusing eyes. Then our friendship
was confirmed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Girls don’t take much time to exchange
their faith.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was uneasy at first, thinking that Ada
might settle herself in a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with me, in
the chit-chat of poetry. I tried to recollect
how the first line of the “Psalm of Life” went,
for Longfellow would of course be the first
one to encounter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas, I had forgotten it all.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was glad that her query did not roam from
the remote corner of poesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you play golf?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>She thinks the same things are going on in
Japan.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ada! Poor Ada!</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>The honourable consul and my uncle looked
stupid at the lunch table.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought they were afraid of being given
some difficult question by the Meriken ladies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Consul and Ada ate like hungry pigs.
(I beg their pardon!)</p>

<p class='c009'>“You eat like a pussy!” is no adequate
compliment to pay to a Meriken woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>I found out that their English was neither
Macaulay’s nor Irving’s.</p>
<p class='c014'>29th—I ate a tongue and some ox-tail soup.</p>

<p class='c009'>Think of a suspicious spumy tongue and
that dirty bamboo tail!</p>

<p class='c009'>Isn’t it shocking to even incline to taste
them?</p>

<p class='c009'>My mother would not permit me to step
into the holy ground of any shrine in Japan.
She would declare me perfectly defiled by such
food.</p>

<p class='c009'>I shall turn into a beast in the jungle by
and by, I should say.</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle committed a greater indecency.
He ate a tripe.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was cooked in the “western sea egg-plant,”
to taste of which brings on the small-pox,
as I have been told.</p>

<p class='c009'>He said that he took a delight in pig’s feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shame on the Nippon gentleman!</p>

<p class='c009'>Harai tamae! Kiyome tamae!</p>
<p class='c014'>30th—“Chui, chui, chui!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A little sparrow was twittering at my hotel
window.</p>

<p class='c009'>I could not believe that the sparrow of large
America could be as small as the Nippon-born.</p>

<p class='c009'>Horses are large here. Woman’s mouth is
large, something like that of an alligator.
Policeman is too large.</p>

<p class='c009'>I fancied that little birdie might be one
strayed from the bamboo bush of my family’s
monastery.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sweet vagabond, did you cross the ocean
for Meriken Kenbutsu?” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chui, chui! Chui, chui, chui!” he
chirped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is “chui, chui” English, I wonder?</p>

<p class='c009'>I pushed the window up to receive him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oya, ma, he has gone!</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt so sorry.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was yearning after my beloved home.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is the great Chrysanthemum season at
home. I missed the show at Dangozaka.</p>

<p class='c009'>How gracefully the time used to pass in
Dai Nippon, while I sat looking at the flowers
on a tokonoma.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every place is a strange gray waste to me
without the intimate faces of flowers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Flowers have no price in Japan, just as a
poet is nothing, for everybody there is poet.
But they have a big value in this city—although
I am not positive that an American
poet creates wealth.</p>

<p class='c009'>I purchased a select bouquet of violets.</p>

<p class='c009'>I passed by several young gentlemen.
Were their eyes set on my flowers or my
hands?</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t wear gloves. I don’t wish my hands
to be touched harshly by them. Truly I am
vain of showing my small hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>I love the violet, because it was the favorite
of dear John—Keats, of course.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may not be a flower. It is decidedly a
perfume, anyhow.</p>
<p class='c014'>31st—I have heard a sad piece of news from
Mrs. Consul about Mr. Longfellow.</p>

<p class='c009'>She says that he has ceased to be an idol of
American ladies.</p>

<p class='c009'>He has retired to a comfortable fireside to
take care of school children.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor old poet!</p>
<p class='c014'>Nov. 1st—American chair is too high.</p>

<p class='c009'>Are my legs too short?</p>

<p class='c009'>It was uncomfortable to sit erect on a chair
all the time as if one were being presented before
the judge.</p>

<p class='c009'>And those corsets and shoes!</p>

<p class='c009'>They seized me mercilessly.</p>

<p class='c009'>I said that I would spend a few hours in
Japan style, reclining on the floor like an
eloped angel.</p>

<p class='c009'>I brought out a crape kimono and my girdle
with the phœnix embroidery, after having
locked the entrance of my room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kotsu, kotsu, kotsu!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Somebody was fisting on my door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oya, she was Ada, my “Rose of Frisco” or
“Butterfly of Van Ness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>(She was quartered in Van Ness Avenue,
the most elegant street of a whole bunch.)</p>

<p class='c009'>She was sprightly as a runaway princess.
She blew her sunlight and fragrance into my
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was grateful that I chanced to be acquainted
with such a delightful Meriken lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O ho, Japanese <i>kimono</i>! If I might only
try it on!” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I told her she could.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How lovely!” she ejaculated.</p>

<p class='c009'>We promised to spend a gala day together.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We will rehearse,” I said, “a one-act
Japanese play entitled ‘Two Cherry Blossom
Musumes.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>I assisted her to dress up. She was utterly
ignorant of Oriental attire.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a superb development she had in
body! Her chest was abundant, her shoulders
gracefully commanding. Her rather
large rump, however, did not show to advantage
in waving dress. Japs prefer a small
one.</p>

<p class='c009'>My physical state is in poverty.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was wrong to believe that the beauty of
woman is in her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is so, of course, in Japan. The brown
woman eternally sits. The face is her complete
exhibition.</p>

<p class='c009'>The beauty of Meriken woman is in her
shape.</p>

<p class='c009'>I pray that my body may grow.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Japanese theatre never begins without
three rappings of time-honoured wooden
blocks.</p>

<p class='c009'>I knocked on the pitcher.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Ada appeared from the dressing room,
fluttering an open fan.</p>

<p class='c009'>How ridiculously she stepped!</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the way Miss What’s-her-name acted
in “The Geisha,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was much taller than little me. The
kimono scarcely reached to her shoes. I have
never seen such an absurd show in my life.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was tittering.</p>

<p class='c009'>The charming Ada fanned and giggled incessantly
in supposed-to-be Japanese <i>chic</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What have I to say, Morning Glory?”
she said, looking up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know, dear girl!” I jerked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then we both laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ada caught my neck by her arm. She
squandered her kisses on me.</p>

<p class='c009'>(It was my first taste of the kiss.)</p>

<p class='c009'>We two young ladies in wanton garments
rolled down happily on the floor.</p>
<p class='c014'>2nd—If I could be a gentleman for just one
day!</p>

<p class='c009'>I would rest myself on the hospitable chair
of a barber shop—barber shop, drug store and
candy store are three beauties on the street—like
a prince of leisure, and dream something
great, while the man is busy with a razor.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am envious of the gentleman who may
bathe in such a purple hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>I never rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>American ladies neither!</p>

<p class='c009'>Each one of them looks worried as if she
expected the door-bell any moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>I suppose it is the penalty of being a woman.</p>
<p class='c014'>3rd—My little heart was flooded with patriotism.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is our Mikado’s birthday.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sang “The Age of Our Sovereign.” I
shouted “Ten thousand years! Banzai! Ban
banzai!”</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle and I hurried to the Japanese
Consulate to celebrate this grand day.</p>
<p class='c014'>4th—The gentlemen of San Francisco are
gallant.</p>

<p class='c009'>They never permit the ladies—even a black
servant is in the honourable list of “ladies”—to
stand in the car.</p>

<p class='c009'>If Oriental gentlemen could demean themselves
like that for just one day!</p>

<p class='c009'>I should not mind a bit if one proposed to
me even.</p>

<p class='c009'>I love a handsome face.</p>

<p class='c009'>They part their hair in the middle. They
have inherited no bad habit of biting their
finger-nails. I suppose they offer a grace before
each meal. Their smile isn’t sardonic,
and their laughter is open.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have no dispute with their mustaches and
their blue eyes. But I am far from being an
admirer of their red faces.</p>

<p class='c009'>Japs are pygmies. I fear that the Americans
are too tall. My future husband is not
allowed to be over five feet five inches. His
nose should be of the cast of Robert Stevenson’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each one of them carries a high look. He
may be the President at the next election, he
seems to say. How mean that only one head
is in demand!</p>

<p class='c009'>A directory and a dictionary are kind. The
’Merican husband is like them, I imagine.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have no gentleman friend yet.</p>

<p class='c009'>To pace alone on the street is a melancholy
discarded sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>What do you do if your shoe-string comes
untied?</p>

<p class='c009'>I have seen a gentleman fingering the shoestrings
of a lady. How glad he was to serve
again, when she said, “That’s too tight!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Shall my uncle fill such a part?</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor uncle!</p>

<p class='c009'>Old company, however, isn’t style.</p>

<p class='c009'>He is forty-five.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why can I not choose one to hire from
among the “bully” young men loitering
around a cigar-stand?</p>
<p class='c014'>5th—My uncle was going out in a black
frock-coat and tea-coloured trousers. I insisted
that his coat and trousers didn’t match.</p>

<p class='c009'>How can a man be so ridiculous?</p>

<p class='c009'>I declared that it was as poor taste as for a
darkey to wear a red ribbon in her smoky
hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle surrendered.</p>

<p class='c009'>He said, “Hei, hei, hei!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Goo’ boy!</p>

<p class='c009'>He dismissed the great tea-colour.</p>
<p class='c014'>6th—We had a shower.</p>

<p class='c009'>The city dipped in a bath.</p>

<p class='c009'>The pedestrians threw their vaguely delicate
shadows on the pavements. The ladies voluntarily
permitted the gentlemen to review their
legs. If I were in command, I would not permit
the ladies to raise an umbrella under the
“para para” of a shower. Their hastening
figures are so fascinating.</p>

<p class='c009'>The shower stopped. The pavements were
glossed like a looking-glass. The windows
facing the sun scattered their sparkling laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>How beautiful!</p>

<p class='c009'>I am perfectly delighted by this city.</p>

<p class='c009'>One thing that disappoints me, however, is
that Frisco is eternally snowless,</p>

<p class='c009'>Without snow the year is incomplete, like a
departure without sayonara.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dear snow! O Yuki San!</p>

<p class='c009'>Many Winters ago I modelled a doll of
snow, which was supposed to be a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c009'>How proud I used to be when I stamped
the first mark with my high ashida on the
white ground before anyone else!</p>

<p class='c009'>I wonder how Santa Claus will array himself
to call on this town.</p>

<p class='c009'>His fur coat is not appropriate at all.</p>
<p class='c014'>7th—Why didn’t I come to Amerikey
earlier—in the Summer season?</p>

<p class='c009'>I was staring sadly at my purple parasol
against the wall by my dresser.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have no chance to show it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have often been told that I look so beautiful
under it.</p>
<p class='c014'>8th—My darling O Ada came in a carriage.
Her two-horsed carriage was like that of our
Japanese premier.</p>

<p class='c009'>She is the daughter of a banker.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun shone in yellow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ada’s complexion added a brilliancy. I
was shocked, fearing that I looked awfully
brown.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ada said that I was “perfectly lovely.”
Can I trust a woman’s eulogy?</p>

<p class='c009'>I myself often use flattery.</p>

<p class='c009'>A jewel and face-powder were not the only
things, I said, essential to woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>We drove to the Golden Gate Park and
then to the Cliff House.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a triumphant sound the hoofs of the
bay horses struck! I fancied the horses were
a poet, they were rhyming.</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t like the automobile.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ada was sweet as could be.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me your honourable love story!” she
chattered.</p>

<p class='c009'>I did only blush.</p>

<p class='c009'>I hadn’t the courage to burst my secrecy.</p>

<p class='c009'>I loved once truly.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was an innocent love as from a fairy
book.</p>

<p class='c009'>If true love could be realised!</p>

<p class='c009'>In the park I noticed a lady who scissored
the “don’t touch” flowers and stepped away
with a saintly air. The comical fancy came to
me that she was the mother of a policeman
guarding against intruders.</p>

<p class='c009'>We found ourselves in the Japanese tea
garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>A tiny musume in wooden clogs brought us
an honourable tea and o’senbe.</p>

<p class='c009'>The grounds were an imitation of Japanese
landscape gardening.</p>

<p class='c009'>Homesickness ran through my fibre.</p>

<p class='c009'>The decorative bridge, a stork by the brook,
and the dwarf plants hinted to me of my
home garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>A sudden vibration of shamisen was flung
from the Japanese cottage close by.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tenu, tenu! Tenu, tsunn shann!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Who was the player?</p>

<p class='c009'>When I sat myself by the ocean on the
beach I found some packages of peanuts right
before me.</p>

<p class='c009'>The beautiful Ada began to snap them.</p>

<p class='c009'>She hummed a jaunty ditty. Her head inclined
pathetically against my shoulder. My
hair, stirred by the sea zephyrs, patted her
cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>She said the song was “My Gal’s a High-Born
Lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Who was its author? Emerson did not
write it surely.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>When I returned to the hotel, I undertook
to place on the wall the weather-torn fragment
of cotton which I had picked up at the park.</p>

<p class='c009'>These words were printed on it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='large'>“KEEP OFF</span></div>
      <div class='line in1'><span class='large'>THE GRASS.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I decided to mail it to my Japan, requesting
my daddy to post it upon my garden grasses—somewhere
by the old cherry tree.</p>
<p class='c014'>9th—To-day is the third anniversary of my
grandmother’s death.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will keep myself in devotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>I burned the incense I had bought from a
Chinaman. I watched the beautiful gesticulation
of its smoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>Good Grandma!</p>

<p class='c009'>She wished she could live long enough to
be present at my wedding ceremony. She
prayed that she might select the marriage
equipage for me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am alone yet.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wonder if she knows—does her ghost
peep from the grasses?—that I am drifting
among the ijins she ever loathed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t see how to manage myself sometimes—like
an unskilful fictionist with his
heroine.</p>

<p class='c009'>When shall I get married?</p>
<p class='c014'>10th—I yawned.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing is more unbecoming to a woman
than yawning.</p>

<p class='c009'>I think it no offence to swear once in a
while in one’s closet.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>I tore to pieces my “Things Seen in the
Street,” and fed the waste-paper basket with
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The basket looked so hungry without any
rubbish. An unkept basket is more pleasing,
like a soiled autograph-book.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t come to Amerikey to be critical,
that is, to act mean, did I?” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I must remain an Oriental girl, like a cherry
blossom smiling softly in the Spring moonlight.</p>

<p class='c009'>But afterwards I felt sorry for my destruction.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thrust my hand into the basket. I plucked
them up. They were illegibly as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>And I missed some other hundred lines.</p>
<p class='c014'>11th—A letter from the minister arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>(I’d be a postman, by the way, if I were a
man. A noble work that is to deliver around
the love and “gokigen ukagai.”)</p>

<p class='c009'>I clipped off the Mexican stamp.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will make a stamp book for my boy who
may be born when I become a wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before opening the letter I pressed it to my
ear. My imaginative ear heard his illustrious
“Ha, ha, ha——” rolling out.</p>

<p class='c009'>How I missed his happy laughter!</p>

<p class='c009'>Can he now pronounce a “How do?” in
Mexican?</p>
<p class='c014'>12th—It surprises me to learn that many an
American is born and dies in a hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a life—however large rooms you may
possess—is not distinguishable, in my opinion,
from that of a bird in a cage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is hotel-living a recent fashion?</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’t say so!</p>

<p class='c009'>The business locality—like the place where
this Palace Hotel takes its seat—does not
afford a stomachful of respectable air.</p>

<p class='c009'>I preferred some hospitable boarding house
in a quiet street, where I might even step up
and down in nude feet. I wished to occupy a
chamber where the morning sun could steal in
and shake my sleepy little head with golden
fingers as my beloved mama might do.</p>

<p class='c009'>We will move to the “high-toned” boarding
house of Mrs. Willis this afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her house is placed on the high hill of
California Street.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am grateful there is no car quaking along
there.</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle says I shall have a whole lot of
millionaires for neighbours.</p>

<p class='c009'>California must be one dignified street.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Chinese colony is close at hand from
Mrs. Willis’,—the exotic exposition brilliant
with green and yellow colour. The incense
surges. So cute is the sparrow-eyed Asiatic
girl—such a “karako”—with a small cue on
only one side of the head. Dear Oriental
town!</p>

<p class='c009'>Good luck, I pray, my Palace Hotel!</p>

<p class='c009'>Sayonara, my graceful butlers!</p>

<p class='c009'>I shall hear no more of their sweet “Yes,
Madam!” They talk gently as a lottery-seller.</p>

<p class='c009'>The more they bow and smile the more you
will press the button of tips.</p>

<p class='c009'>They are so funny.</p>

<p class='c009'>So long, everybody!</p>
<p class='c014'>13th—The savour of the air is rich without
being heavy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Tokio atmosphere emits a lassitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>It’s natural that the Japs are prone to
languor.</p>

<p class='c009'>A good while ago I pushed down my window
facing the Bay of San Francisco. I
leaned on the sill, my face propped up by
both my hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>The grand scenery absorbed my whole soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ideal place, isn’t it?” I emphasised.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bay was dyed in profound blue.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Oakland boat joggled on happily as
from a fairy isle. My visionary eyes caught
the heavenly flock of seagulls around it.</p>

<p class='c009'>If I could fly in their company!</p>

<p class='c009'>The low mountains over the bay looked inexpressively
comfortable, like one sleeping
under a warm blanket.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moon-night view from here must be
wonderful.</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt a new stream of blood beginning to
swell within my body.</p>

<p class='c009'>I buzzed a silly song.</p>

<p class='c009'>I crept into my uncle’s room.</p>

<p class='c009'>I stole one stalk of his cigarettes.</p>

<p class='c009'>I bit it, aping Mr. Uncle, when my door
banged.</p>
<p class='c014'>14th—I bustled back to my room.</p>

<p class='c009'>My breast throbbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>A naked woman in an oil painting stood
before me in the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is Mrs. Willis a lady worthy of respect?</p>

<p class='c009'>It is nothing but an insulting stroke to an
Oriental lady—yes sir, I’m a lady—to expose
such an obscenity.</p>

<p class='c009'>I brought down one of my crape haoris,
raven-black in hue, with blushing maple leaves
dispersed on the sleeves, and cloaked the
honourable picture.</p>

<p class='c009'>My haori wasn’t long enough.</p>

<p class='c009'>The feet of the nude woman were all seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have not the least objection to the undraped
feet. They were faultless in shape.</p>

<p class='c009'>I myself am free to bestow a glimpse of my
beautiful feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>I turned the key of my door.</p>

<p class='c009'>I stripped off my shoes and my stockings
also.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dear red silken stockings!</p>

<p class='c009'>I scrutinised my feet for a while. Then I
asked myself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which is lovelier, my feet or those in the
painting?”</p>
<p class='c014'>15th—I couldn’t rest last night.</p>

<p class='c009'>The long wail of a horn somewhere in the
distance—at the gate of the ocean perhaps—haunted
me. The night was foggy.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had a wild dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fogs were not withdrawn this morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was discouraged, I had to go out in my
best gown.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wasn’t it a shame that two buttons jumped
out when I hurried to dress up?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are the buttons secure?” is my first
worry and the last.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why don’t Meriken inventors take up the
subject of buttonless clothes?</p>

<p class='c009'>Woman cannot be easy while her dress is
fastened by only buttons.</p>
<p class='c014'>16th—I wish I could pay my bill with a
bank check.</p>

<p class='c009'>Have I money in the bank with my name?</p>

<p class='c009'>I fancied it a great idea to sleep with a big
bank book under the pillow.</p>

<p class='c009'>I decided to save my money hereafter.</p>

<p class='c009'>How often have I expressed my hatred of
an economical woman!</p>

<p class='c009'>I detested the clinking “charin charan” of
small coins in my purse. Very hard I tried
to get from them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Extravagance is a folly. Folly is only a
mild expression for crime.</p>

<p class='c009'>I deducted ten dollars from the fifty that I
had settled for my new street gown. I
dropped a card notifying my ladies’ tailor
that I had altered my mind for the second
price.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ten already for the bank!” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I took it to the “Yokohama Shokin Ginko”
of this city.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was given a little book for the first time
in my life.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought myself quite a wealthy woman
preserving my money in the bank.</p>

<p class='c009'>I pressed the book to my face. I held it
close to my bosom as a tiny girl with a new doll.</p>

<p class='c009'>And I smiled into a looking-glass.</p>
<p class='c014'>17th—I went to the gallery of the photographer
Taber, and posed in Nippon “pera
pera.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The photographer spread before me many
pictures of the actress in the part of “Geisha.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was absurd.</p>

<p class='c009'>I cannot comprehend where ’Mericans get
the conception that Jap girls are eternally
smiling puppets.</p>

<p class='c009'>Are we crazy to smile without motive?</p>

<p class='c009'>What an untidy presence!</p>

<p class='c009'>She didn’t even fasten the front of her
kimono.</p>

<p class='c009'>Charm doesn’t walk together with disorder
under the same Japanese parasol.</p>

<p class='c009'>And I had the honour to be presented to an
extraordinary mode in her hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>It might be entitled “ghost style.” It suggested
an apparition in the “Botan Toro”
played by kikugoro.</p>

<p class='c009'>The photographer handed me a fan.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas! It was a Chinese fan in a crude mixture
of colour.</p>

<p class='c009'>He urged me to carry it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I declined, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nobody fans in cool November!”</p>
<p class='c014'>18th—We had a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ada, my sweet singer of “My Gal’s a
High-Born Lady,” accompanied me to a matinée
of one vaudeville.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is the age of quick turn, sudden flashes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The long show has ceased to be the fashion.
Modern people are tired of the slowness
of old times which was once supposed to be
seriousness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Could anything be prouder than the face of
the acrobat retiring after a perilous performance?</p>

<p class='c009'>Woman tumbler!</p>

<p class='c009'>I wondered how Meriken ladies could enjoy
looking at such a degeneration of woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was glad, however, that I did not see any
snake-charmer.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a delightful voice that negro had!
Who could imagine that such a silvery sound
could come from such a midnight face? It
was like clear water out of the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was struck by a fancy.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sprang up.</p>

<p class='c009'>I attempted to imitate the high-kick dance.</p>

<p class='c009'>I fell down abruptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jap’s short leg is no use in Amerikey—can’t
achieve one thing. I am frankly tired
of mine,” I grumbled.</p>
<p class='c014'>19th—The Sunday chime was the voice of
an angel. The city turned religious.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Willis—I had no curiosity about her
first name; it is meaningless for the “Mrs.” of
middle age—indulged in chat with me.</p>

<p class='c009'>If I say she was “sociable”?—it sounds so
graceful.</p>

<p class='c009'>She announced herself a bigot of poetry.
She was bending to make a full poetical
demonstration.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course it was more pleasing than a
mourning-gowned narrative of her lamented
husband. (I suppose he is dead, as divorce is
too commonplace.)</p>

<p class='c009'>But it were treachery, if I were put under her
long recital of the insignificant works of local
poets.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tasukatta wa!</p>

<p class='c009'>A little girl came as a relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dorothy! She is a boarder of Mrs. Willis’,
the golden-haired daughter of Mrs. Browning.</p>

<p class='c009'>(Mrs. Browning was a disappointment, however.
I fancied she might be a relative of the
poet Browning. I asked about it. Her response
was an unsympathetic “No!”)</p>

<p class='c009'>“O’ hayo!” Dorothy said, spattering over
me her familiarity.</p>

<p class='c009'>It takes only an hour to be friends with the
Meriken girl, while it is the work of a year
with a Japanese musume.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great girl! Your Nippon language is perfect!
Would you like to learn more?” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like it,” was her retort.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then we slipped to my room.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wonder how Mrs. Willis fared without an
audience!</p>

<p class='c009'>I was sorry, thinking that she might regard
me as an uncivil Jap.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chon kina! Chon kina!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus Dorothy repeated. It was a Japanese
song, she said, which the geisha girls sung in
“The Geisha.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tat, tat, tat, stop, Dorothy!</p>

<p class='c009'>Truly it was the opening sound—not the
words—of a nonsensical song.</p>

<p class='c009'>I presume that “The Geisha” is practising
a plenteous injustice to Dai Nippon.</p>

<p class='c009'>I recalled one Meriken consul who jolted
out that same song once at a party.</p>

<p class='c009'>He became no more a gentleman to me after
that.</p>
<p class='c014'>20th—I pasted my little card on my door.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wrote on it “Japanese Lessons Given.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I gazed at it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was exceedingly happy.</p>
<p class='c014'>21st—A gardener came to fix our lawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is nothing lovelier than verdant
grasses trimmed neatly. They are like the
short skirt of the Meriken little girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>We women could be angels, I thought, if
our speech lapped justly. Women talk superfluously.
I do often.</p>

<p class='c009'>What language did that gardener use?</p>

<p class='c009'>It must be the English of Carlyle, I said, for
its meaning was intangible.</p>

<p class='c009'>I discovered, by and by, that German English
was his honourable choice.</p>

<p class='c009'>My eyes could express more than my English
uttered in Nippon voice. My gestures
helped to make my meaning plain.</p>

<p class='c009'>He became my friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>He carried a red square of cotton to wipe
his mouth, like the furoshiki in which a Japanese
country “O’ ba san” wraps her New
Year’s present.</p>

<p class='c009'>And again as he was leaving I saw a red
thing around his neck.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was it not the same furoshiki which served
for his nose?</p>

<p class='c009'>It wouldn’t be a bad idea to play amateur
gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>The season wasn’t fitting for such a performance,
however.</p>

<p class='c009'>A large summer hat! That was the customary
attire.</p>

<p class='c009'>But my light-hearted straw one with its
laughing bouquet was not adapted to November,
however gorgeously the sun might shine.</p>

<p class='c009'>And it’s sheer stupidity to track after a
tradition.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wound a large flapping piece of black crape
about my head. (How awfully becoming the
garb of a Catholic nun would be! I do not
know what is dear, if it is not the rosary. A
writhing rope around the waist is celestial
carelessness.)</p>

<p class='c009'>I appeared on the lawn, but without a
sprinkler and rake. It would have been too
theatrical to carry them.</p>

<p class='c009'>I gathered the small stones from amid the
grasses into a wheelbarrow near by.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as my new enterprise was beginning
to seem so delightful, the luncheon gong
gonged.</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle goggled from the hall, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where have you been? I was afraid you
had eloped.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve no chance yet to meet a boy,” I spoke
in an undertone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Afterward I was ashamed that I had been
so awkwardly sincere.</p>
<p class='c014'>22nd—There was one thing that I wanted
to test.</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle went out. I understood that he
would not be back for some hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>I found myself in his room, pulling out his
drawer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t it elegant?” I exclaimed, picking up
his dress-suit.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last I had an opportunity to examine how
I would look in a tapering coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentleman’s suit is fascinating.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is his silk hat?” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I reached up my arms to the top shelf of a
closet, standing on the chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>The door swung open.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tamageta! My liver was crushed by the
alarm.</p>

<p class='c009'>A chambermaid threw her suspicious smile
at me.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas!</p>

<p class='c009'>My adventure failed.</p>
<p class='c014'>23rd—I mean no one else but O Ada San,
when I say “my sweet girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was tremendously nice, giving a tea-party
in my honour.</p>

<p class='c009'>The star actress doesn’t appear on the stage
from the first of the first act. I thought I
would present myself a bit later at the party,
when they were tattling about my delay.</p>

<p class='c009'>I delight in employing such little dramatic
arts.</p>

<p class='c009'>I dressed all in silk. It’s proper, of course,
for a Japanese girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>I chose cherry blossoms in preference to
roses for my hat. Roses are acceptable, however,
I said in my second thought, for they are
given a thorn against affronters.</p>

<p class='c009'>I went to Miss Ada’s looking my best.</p>

<p class='c009'>They—six young ladies in a bunch—stretched
out their hands. I was coaxed by
their hailing smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ada kissed me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had no charming manner in receiving a
kiss before the people no more than in giving
one. I blushed miserably. I knew I was
bungling.</p>

<p class='c009'>O Morning Glory, you are one century
late!</p>

<p class='c009'>They besieged me.</p>

<p class='c009'>None of them was so pretty as Ada. Beauty
is rare, I perceive, like good tweezers or ideal
men.</p>

<p class='c009'>I distributed my Japanese cards.</p>

<p class='c009'>All of my new friends held them upside
down.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is it a modern vogue to be ignorant?</p>

<p class='c009'>Ada played skilfully her role of hostess,
which was a middle-aged part. She didn’t even
spill the tea in serving. Her “Sugar? Two
lumps?” sounded fit. She divided her entertaining
eye-flashes among us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tea is the thing for afternoon, when woman
is excused if she be silly.</p>

<p class='c009'>We all undressed our too-tight coat of
rhetoric in the sipping of tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>We laughed, and laughed harder, not seeing
what we were laughing at.</p>

<p class='c009'>I couldn’t catch all of their names.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a delicious name as “Lily” was
absurdly given to a girl with red blotches on
her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>(A few blemishes are a fascination, however,
like slang thrown in the right place.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Her flippancy was like the “buku buku” of
a stream.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lightness didn’t match with her heavy
physique.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How lovely an earthquake must be!” she
chirruped. “Shall I go to Japan just on
that account? A jolly moment I had last
February. A baby earthquake visited here,
as you know. I was drinking tea. The
worst of it was that I let the cup tumble on
to my pink dress. I prayed a whole week,
nevertheless, to be called again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Woman has nothing to do with a hideous
make-up. Miss Lily should not select a pink
hue.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are awful!” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I told about the horror of a certain famous
Japanese earthquake. They all breathed out
“Good heavens!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was one second of silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ada struck a gushing melody on the piano.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lively Meriken ladies prompted themselves
to frisk about.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was ready to cry in my destitution.</p>

<p class='c009'>One girl hauled me up violently by the hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come and dance!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her arm crawled around my waist, while
she directed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right foot—now, left!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I returned to Mrs. Willis’, my thoughts
absorbed in a dancing academy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must learn how to skip,” I said.</p>
<p class='c014'>24th—I hate the alarm clock, simply because
it is always so punctual.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was too late” is a delightful expression.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Willis’ breakfast is at quarter-past
eight!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Isn’t that “quarter-past” interesting?</p>

<p class='c009'>And I can never be ready before nine.</p>
<p class='c014'>25th—I dragged my uncle off to the Chute
to enrich my store of zoology.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One gape more, Uncle, to count up one
dozen!” I said, and pulled his mustache in the
car.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was lucky that no one saw my act.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Oji San! Playing chaperon is not a
very promising occupation, is it?</p>

<p class='c009'>I stood by the “happy family” of monkeys.
I tried to descry their point of view in orations.</p>

<p class='c009'>I gave it up.</p>

<p class='c009'>The vain Miss Polly worked hard to bring
everybody to an understanding with one eternal
“Hello, dear!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I found such grace in the elephant when he
waved his honourable trunk.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stupid Mr. Elephant wasn’t stupid a
bit in accepting my present.</p>

<p class='c009'>How philosophically he gazed at me! Very
likely I was the first Jap girl to his audience.</p>

<p class='c009'>What respectable eyes!</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll bankrupt yourself in peanuts,” my
uncle warned.</p>
<p class='c014'>26th—A white apron on my black dress
makes me so cute.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am just suited to be a chambermaid. Shall
I volunteer as a servant?</p>

<p class='c009'>I bought an apron.</p>

<p class='c009'>To-day is house-cleaning day.</p>

<p class='c009'>I kept busy a good while arranging my
theatrical costume as a maid.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wasn’t it fun?</p>

<p class='c009'>I was ready to scrub the floor, when I
heard “kotsu kotsu,” on my door.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Annie with a broom.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m your help. Just a moment! I have
forgotten the finishing glance in my mirror.”</p>
<p class='c014'>27th—I have been studying the catechism.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am afraid to go to church, for the minister
may put many a question to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is Miss Ada a dutiful church-goer?</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t think so.</p>

<p class='c009'>She would rather mumble a nigger song than
a chapter from the Bible.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will ask her a few things from the catechism
at my first opportunity.</p>
<p class='c014'>28th—“Hand me your cup after you are
done with your tea!” Mrs. Browning requested.
“I will ponder on your fortune.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How delightful!” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>My fortune?</p>

<p class='c009'>I remembered how I used to scatter my
pocket money among the fortune-tellers,
pleased to be informed of a lot of nice things.</p>

<p class='c009'>What meaning she could find in a cup!</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt like a mother with her children already
in bed, when I dropped my spoon into my
tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt mistress of the situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was there ever anything more welcome than
to learn your fortune?</p>

<p class='c009'>“A young American (rich, very rich—indeed)
will win your affection. The marriage
will be a happy one,” she prophesied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is that so?</p>

<p class='c009'>Life is becoming very interesting.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wonder where my would-be husband is
seeking me.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shall I advertise in a paper?</p>

<p class='c009'>How?</p>

<p class='c009'>If my first-rate picture by Mr. Taber were
printed, it would be a whole thing in such a
business.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought the picture beautiful enough to
sell at any stationer’s of U.S.A.</p>

<p class='c009'>How many thousand could I sell in a week?</p>

<p class='c009'>Could I make money out of it? Some decent
fortune, I mean, of course.</p>
<p class='c014'>29th—Ho, ho, such a day!</p>

<p class='c009'>I was aroused by the roar of a milk-wagon
early in the morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sought a pin in vain.</p>

<p class='c009'>I tore my skirt on a sneering nail at the
door.</p>

<p class='c009'>I upset my flower-vase.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sat by my window. A vegetable pedlar
howled to me, “Potatoes? Potatoes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I couldn’t recall a sweet dream I had last
night.</p>

<p class='c009'>The clamour of a Chinese funeral passed
under my room. The carriages were packed
with hired “crying women.” Isn’t it a farce?</p>

<p class='c009'>I went out. My street-car ran off the
track.</p>

<p class='c009'>A fire-engine deafened me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I passed by an undertaker’s. It was cold
like a grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sight stunned me.</p>
<p class='c014'>30th—Is my nose high enough?</p>

<p class='c009'>I bought a pair of “nose spectacles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Those with wires to circle the ears, which
are Oriental (that is to say old-fashioned),
would suit even a noseless Formosa Chinee.</p>

<p class='c009'>But how many Japs could show themselves
ready for nose spectacles?</p>

<p class='c009'>The Optician asked if they were for myself.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a trifle uncertain about my nose,
I suppose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! For my friend,” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a white lie.</p>

<p class='c009'>I blushed as if I had committed a heavy
crime.</p>

<p class='c009'>I hoped I had not.</p>

<p class='c009'>I put my new spectacles on my nose, as
soon as I returned to my room. Very well
they stayed. Mother Nature was specially
kind to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>But what a depression—also what torture—I
felt from their clutch!</p>

<p class='c009'>I was pleased, however, seeing myself somewhat
scholarly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aren’t spectacles an emblem of wisdom?</p>

<p class='c009'>The first requirement to be a critic should
be spectacles. The second is a pessimistic
smile, of course.</p>

<p class='c009'>My mirror told me that I looked quite
modern.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Book!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I must see what effect I could produce with
a book on my lap.</p>

<p class='c009'>I leaped from the chair to fetch one.</p>

<p class='c009'>My spectacles dropped from my honourable
nose on to the hearthstone. My nose was
exceedingly stupid.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas, and alas!</p>

<p class='c009'>The spectacles were crushed to pieces.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was broken also.</p>

<p class='c009'>I buried my face in the pillow for some time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I said: “I’m not short in my sight.
I have no use for them except for fun.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I wiped my disturbed eyes with a handkerchief.
My finger felt the rude marks printed
on both sides of my nose.</p>
<p class='c014'>Dec. 1st—I bought a Louisiana lottery
ticket through Annie.</p>

<p class='c009'>Like any other domestic girl, she has no
key to her mouth. She is like a sentence
that has forgotten to add the period.</p>

<p class='c009'>I begged all sorts of gods to drop the capital
prize on me.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thirty thousand dollars! Think!</p>

<p class='c009'>How shall I manage with them when I have
won?</p>
<p class='c014'>2nd—If I were a painter!</p>

<p class='c009'>My eyes were fixed upon the dying sun.
Its solemnity was like the passing of a mighty
king.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some time glided by.</p>

<p class='c009'>My thought was pursuing the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>The twilight!</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, twilight pacifying me as with the odour
from a magical palace!</p>

<p class='c009'>Hush!</p>

<p class='c009'>The melody of a piano effused from my
neighbour.</p>

<p class='c009'>The best thing in the world is to play
music. The very best is to listen to the profuse
melody evoked by a master.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was it a superb execution?</p>

<p class='c009'>My soul was dissolved, anyhow, in the
rapture.</p>

<p class='c009'>I left my uncle’s room where I saw the
grand sun pass away.</p>

<p class='c009'>I put me in my bed, because my visionary
mood was not to be stirred for the world, and
because I wished to dream a romance without
the delay of a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I could not slumber.</p>

<p class='c009'>And I missed my dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>I petitioned my uncle to step out into the
street for my beloved chestnuts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dear Italian chestnut vendor!</p>

<p class='c009'>I never pass by without buying.</p>
<p class='c014'>3rd—We start to-morrow for Los Angeles
of Southern California.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. and Mrs. Schuyler have invited us to
spend some weeks with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gentleman was the former consul at
Yokohama. My uncle is his intimate friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>My new trunk was brought in from the
store.</p>

<p class='c009'>It bears my name in Roman of commanding
type.</p>

<p class='c009'>I stared at the characters as upon an ancient
writing whose meaning could only be imagined.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doesn’t ‘Miss Morning Glory’ suggest
that the owner is a charming young lady?”</p>

<p class='c009'>My little smile smiled, as I thought that it
would, of course.</p>

<p class='c009'>A new trunk, I am sorry to say, lacks a
historical look. An old one is more gratifying,
like old brocade or an old ring.</p>

<p class='c009'>Au revoir, my Ada!</p>
<p class='c014'>South-bound train, 4th—I was lavish of my
art of “bothering.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My poor uncle—my eternally “poor uncle”
was the victim. I wanted some diversion at
any price.</p>

<p class='c009'>His face scowled as I bored him with my
successive questions.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought his irritated face fascinating.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I presented another question, he was
droning a genteel snore.</p>

<p class='c009'>I twisted an edge of a newspaper into a
roll. I thrust it into his nose.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no doubt about his starting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bikkurishita!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he begged to be allowed some chance
to rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is a “bad year for cucumbers” for him.
He made a mistake in accompanying me on
Meriken Kenbutsu.</p>

<p class='c009'>Honestly I have to behave nicely.</p>

<p class='c009'>My opening question to Uncle was: “What’s
the derivation of ‘damn’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Imperialism” was my last.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have a high regard for the people dignified
by using the capital “I” for the personal
pronoun.</p>

<p class='c009'>But if I were the President I should not wish
to be addressed with that hackneyed, unromantic
“Mr.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The cartoonists making sport of the President
shock me.</p>

<p class='c009'>How big-hearted the President is!</p>

<p class='c009'>Those “devils” would be beheaded in the
Orient.</p>
<p class='c014'>Los Angeles, 5th—No one bangs the door
at Schuyler’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>The servants drop their eyes meekly before
they speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>A well-bred atmosphere circulates.</p>

<p class='c009'>A woman over forty-five is nothing if she
isn’t motherly enough to let one feel at home.
Mrs. Schuyler’s silence is a smile. I loved
her from my first glance. I thought I could
ask her to wash my hair some sunny day. I
could fancy how pleasant it would be to immerse
myself in her chat—such sort of talk as
an old-bonneted “how to keep house”—while
I was drying my hair in the indolence of a
sea-nymph. Modern topic is like black coffee,
it is too stimulating. There is nothing dearer
than a domestic subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have no hesitation in accepting her as my
Meriken mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am positive I would feel more comfortable
if I had one in this country.</p>

<p class='c009'>How good-naturedly she was fattened!</p>

<p class='c009'>A somewhat stout woman looks so proper
for a mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wished I could lean on her plump shoulder
from the back in Japanese girl’s way, and play
with her hair, and ask a few innocent questions
like “What have I to eat for dinner?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She talked about the Japanese woman,
principally praising her shapely mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt conceitedly, because I was given one
classical little mouth, if I had nothing else to
be noticed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Schuyler grasped my hand ever so
hard. My hand was buried in his palm.
His manner was courteously boyish.</p>

<p class='c009'>His body is erect like a redwood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such an old gentleman gives me the impression
of another race from the divine
realm of everlasting youth. A Jap after fifty
is capped with “retired.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the work of the American gentleman is
only finished when he dies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Great Meriken Jin!</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Schuyler shows more civility to his
servants than to his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here I can study the typical household of
America’s best caste.</p>
<p class='c014'>6th—“Anata donata?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I rubbed my dreamy eyes, scanning my room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Who was the Japanese speaker?</p>

<p class='c009'>I crept to the door, and opened it slightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not a soul was there.</p>

<p class='c009'>I heard the trivial clatter of the kitchen stepping
up.</p>

<p class='c009'>I dipped into my bed again. I smiled sceptically,
thinking that I must have been dreaming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gokigen ikaga?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was addressed again by the same voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>I said that there was positively some mischief
in my room.</p>

<p class='c009'>I leaped down from the bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I inspected my slippers. I made sure there
was nothing strange under the pictures on the
wall. I tugged at the drawers. I tumbled
every blanket. I pried in the pitcher.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sat on the bed wrapped in fog.</p>

<p class='c009'>The blind rustled.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sunbeams crawled in marvellously.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I was frightened by another speech,
“Nihonjin desu.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I declared that it flew in from the outside.</p>

<p class='c009'>I rolled up the blind.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oya, oya! There was a parrot perching in a
cage by my window!</p>

<p class='c009'>He adjusted his showy coat first, and then
sent me his inquisitive eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anata donata?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Morning Glory is my insignificant name,
sir,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>A trifling toss of his head showed his satisfaction
in my name. I thought he was trying
to set me at ease with his smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gokigen ikaga?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel splendidly, thank you, Mr. Parrot!”
I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then pressing his head backward he looked
haughtily at me with fixed eyes, and announced:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nihonjin desu.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m also a Jap,” I muttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was the most profound Japanese scholar,
Mrs. Schuyler said, in all Los Angeles. Mr.
Schuyler Jr. brought him from Kobe last
spring.</p>

<p class='c009'>I told her the incident of this morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>She laughed, she said she expected it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bad Mother Schuyler!</p>
<p class='c014'>17th—Dear Baby! Kawaii koto!</p>

<p class='c009'>I hugged the baby of Mrs. Schuyler Jr. and
kissed it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her husband is away in Japan for the tea
business.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the darling baby, I thank the gods,
who received my first kiss.</p>

<p class='c009'>It’s heavenly to stamp love with a kiss.
Lips are the portal of the human heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kiss is sweet.</p>

<p class='c009'>I say that it marks an epoch in the spiritual
evolution of the Japanese when they learn
what a kiss is—but not how to kiss.</p>

<p class='c009'>The baby crawled like a sportive crab. It
orationed. It! I felt sorry that “It” would
soon be changed to “He” or “She.” It
caught sight of a piece of burnt match in
the course of its expedition. It turned its
way and clinched it with its fingers. It hastened
to the mother to exhibit it, and waited
patiently with its great game for Mamma’s
praise.</p>

<p class='c009'>I nearly cried in my excitement at such a
pathetic revelation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lovely thing!</p>

<p class='c009'>The baby had blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>My preference wasn’t for blue eyes. I often
snapped at them, saying that they were like a
dead fish’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>But how long can I keep up my ill-will, when
I look with delight upon the blueness in water,
sky and mountain?</p>

<p class='c009'>Isn’t it precious to see the blue pictures on
china?</p>

<p class='c009'>A blue pencil is just the thing to mark on
the margin of a pleasing book.</p>

<p class='c009'>Blue is a poetical hue.</p>

<p class='c009'>Robert Burns was blue-eyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I recalled the first American I met in Tokio,
who seriously questioned whether it was a fact
that Japs butcher a blue-eyed baby.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bakabakashii wa!</p>

<p class='c009'>Japan has no blue eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Japanese are worshippers of any sort of
baby.</p>

<p class='c009'>If American babies were like Chinese girls!</p>

<p class='c009'>I would pile up all my coins to buy one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meriken baby understood how to smile
before how to cry. It is a lady or gentleman
already.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will serve as baby’s nurse if I must support
myself.</p>

<p class='c009'>It’s a high task to be useful to the baby, and
watch its growth as a silent astronomer watches
the stars.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wish I could roll the baby’s carriage day
after day.</p>

<p class='c009'>How sweetly the world would be turning
then!</p>

<p class='c009'>Shall I hire Schuyler’s baby for one day?</p>
<p class='c014'>8th—Is there any more gratifying word than
dinner?</p>

<p class='c009'>I had a “hipp goo’” dinner. (Permit a
Chinese-English expression for once.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Its inviting heaviness was like an honourable
poem by Milton.</p>

<p class='c009'>Schuyler’s house has a Miltonic presence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Electric light is too imposing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Candelabra are like a moon whose beams
are a lenitive song.</p>

<p class='c009'>The nude shoulders of Mrs. Schuyler, Jr.,
crimsoned in the rays from the candelabra.</p>

<p class='c009'>The exposure of some part of the skin is the
highest order of art. How to show it is just
as serious a study as how to clothe it.</p>

<p class='c009'>If I had such supreme shoulders as hers, I
would not pause before displaying them.</p>

<p class='c009'>What falling shoulders are mine!</p>

<p class='c009'>The slope of the shoulders is prized in
Japan. Amerikey is another country, you
know.</p>

<p class='c009'>I appeared at the dinner in my native gown.</p>

<p class='c009'>The things on the table had a high-toned
excellence.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will not forget to have my initials
engraved if I happen to buy any silver.</p>

<p class='c009'>Coffee was served. I felt that an old age
had returned, when eating was only a
dissipation.</p>

<p class='c009'>I’m growing to love Meriken food.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am glad that I don’t see any musty
pudding at Schuylers’, a sight that makes me
ten years older.</p>

<p class='c009'>And another thing I hate is the smell of
cabbage.</p>

<p class='c009'>How pleased I was to see a “chabu chabu”
of shallow water in my finger bowl! Just a
glimpse of water is tasty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our taciturn butler retired from the dining-room
with graceful dignity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The butler has ceased to be a common servant.
He has advanced, I suppose, to the
rank of an ornament of the Meriken household.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sister of Mother Schuyler and her husband
dined with us.</p>

<p class='c009'>The funniest thing about her was that she
kept a few long hairs on her cheek. They
grew from a mole.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may be good luck to preserve them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her husband was surprised when he heard
that we do not use knife and fork at home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bamboo chop-sticks! How dear!</p>
<p class='c014'>9th—I have no belief in the earring.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a savage mode, like the deformed feet
of the Chinese woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>But why did the Meriken lady discard her
veil?</p>

<p class='c009'>Her face behind the veil would appear like
a rose through the Spring mist. It is a
charming thing as ever was fashioned for
woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have seen no lady with a veil in this town.</p>

<p class='c009'>I suppose the Los Angeles women confide
in their faces.</p>

<p class='c009'>They strew more liberty in their grace than
the San Franciscans.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their beauty is informal.</p>

<p class='c009'>The city is enchanting.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am pleased that I am not shown here so
many a “To Let” as in Frisco.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the barefooted Arabs, those street
sparrows, are quite a picture.</p>
<p class='c014'>10th—I promised Mrs. Schuyler, Jr., good
care of her baby for half an hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>I carried it firm on my arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>I jogged out to the garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>The baby faced toward me and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bu, bu! Bu, bu, bu!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt grateful, thinking that it counted me
among its friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>I laid its head on my breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sang a little Japanese lullaby:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Nenneko, nenneko,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Nennekoyo!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Oraga akanbowa</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Itsudekita?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sangatsu sakurano</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sakutokini!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Doride okawoga.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sakurairo.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>(Sleep, sleep, sleep! When was our baby
made? Third month, when the cherry blossoms.
So the honourable face of our child is
cherry-blossom coloured.)</p>

<p class='c009'>The breezes billed and cooed upon the
grasses. An imperial palm cast its rich
shadow.</p>

<p class='c009'>The affectionate sunlight made me think of
a “little Spring” of the Japanese September.
Everything inclined to a siesta in the yellow
air.</p>

<p class='c009'>A tropical touch is the touch of passion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Can you fancy this is the month of December?</p>

<p class='c009'>I cannot.</p>

<p class='c009'>After I put the baby to its nurse, I paced
around a bronze statue upon the lawn, losing
myself in Greek beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I snatched a rose.</p>

<p class='c009'>I pressed it to my nose-tip.</p>
<p class='c014'>12th—Where’s my painstaking description
of Echo Mountain?</p>

<p class='c009'>I made a pleasant trip there yesterday with
Schuyler’s party.</p>

<p class='c009'>I lost my writing penned last night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a heedless tomboy!</p>

<p class='c009'>I idled, watching a spider from my window.
It was framing a net amid the garden trees.
An awfully dignified tom cat glared from under
a bush. I was sorry no game came upon
the scene to his honour. My profound Japanese
scholar was not discouraged by the lack of
an audience. He was busy presenting his polite
“Gokigen ikaga?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I found what I did with my yesterday’s
diary.</p>

<p class='c009'>Areda mono!</p>

<p class='c009'>I wiped my oily hands with it and buried it
in a trash basket.</p>

<p class='c009'>I fixed my hair this morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Morning Glory San, you have to keep your
Nikki in a safe!</p>

<p class='c009'>Great Carlyle wrote his “French Revolution”
twice.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wish I had been given a slice of his persistency.</p>
<p class='c014'>13th—A Bishop visited and lunched with
us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bishop! How I desired to meet one!</p>

<p class='c009'>It had been my fancy, ever since I read of
the venerable Bishop who threw out candle-sticks
to Jean Valjean in Hugo’s book.</p>

<p class='c009'>His name was Myriel.</p>

<p class='c009'>What is my friend’s name? After a man
reaches the bishop’s see, his own name should
retire from actual service. People call him
“Bishop! Bishop!” as if it were a nickname.</p>

<p class='c009'>My bishop had a holy face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is this good man who is staring at
me?” I said to myself at first sight, as Napoleon
said when he saw Myriel.</p>

<p class='c009'>A young churchman is unnatural.</p>

<p class='c009'>The customarily pessimistic face of the
Japanese priest causes aversion.</p>

<p class='c009'>I got what I wanted in my new friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>If I were his daughter, I would comb his
silken hair before he goes to church on Sunday.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was glad he was not thin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ho, ho, ho! He ate meat like anybody
else.</p>

<p class='c009'>He would seem holier if he merely bit a
crust of bread, and sipped three spoonfuls of
tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>After luncheon we strolled through the garden
arm in arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not a bit I blushed. I was as completely
at ease with him as with my papa.</p>

<p class='c009'>He told me of the beauty of Christ. His
soft, deep voice was as from a far-away forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>I plucked a few stems of violets. I fitted
them to his buttonhole.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a little thing pleased him immensely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dear, simple Bishop!</p>

<p class='c009'>I digested what he spoke. I declared that
Christianity was the sun, while Buddhism was
the moon.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun is day and life, and the moon night
and rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>How can we live without the sun? The
moon is poetry.</p>
<p class='c014'>14th—The sky became low, its colour frowning
gray.</p>

<p class='c009'>The winds snarled.</p>

<p class='c009'>December was suddenly calling us.</p>

<p class='c009'>We sat by a snug fire at evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>Its yellow flame suggested a preacher uplifting
his hands in prayer. The fire flickered
in jollity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pachi, pachi, pachi!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The parlour was not lighted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The pictures on the wall were impressive in
the firelight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Any woman looks charming at night and by
the fireside. I felt happy imagining that I
must appear lovely.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fireplace is so dear, like mamma’s lap.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Schuyler brought a chess-board and
challenged.</p>

<p class='c009'>I offered me for a fight.</p>

<p class='c009'>I used to play American chess with a Meriken
missionary who lived in my neighbourhood.
I thought it fun to beat an old man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Namu Tenshoko Daijingu!” I repeated.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gentleman asked what I muttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind! Only a little spell!” I replied
in the lightest fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chess-board was placed between us.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Schuyler, can you sacrifice anything
for the game?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whatever you please, my little woman!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose you make Mrs. Schuyler your
stake! My uncle will be mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha, ha! Very well!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a tactician. I fought hard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas, my game was lost!</p>

<p class='c009'>My second stake was myself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It means that I may marry you, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As you please, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Iyani natta!</p>

<p class='c009'>He was far superior.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oya, oya, I was a loser again!</p>

<p class='c009'>I looked sadly on my uncle, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle, you cannot return home! We are
the property of Mr. Schuyler. Isn’t it really
too bad?”</p>
<p class='c014'>15th—Shall I make a little kimono for
Schuyler’s baby?</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be a souvenir of my visit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The crape kept in the Jap stores of this
town isn’t appropriate for a baby’s “bebe.”
My flower-dyed under-kimono should be
utilized.</p>

<p class='c009'>I opened my trunk.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mother Schuyler brought in a young lady.
She was her niece, that is to say the daughter
of Mrs. Ellis. Mrs. Ellis is the one with the
long hair on her cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>I told them of my new drift.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were surprised at my determination.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Olive applied to be my pupil in Japanese
sewing.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a southern name! Olive perfectly
fits for a girl born in the passionate breeze.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her “Is that so?” or “Don’t you?” fluttered
affectionately like golden sunshine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Schuyler bade her servant to move in
the machine.</p>

<p class='c009'>I objected.</p>

<p class='c009'>Machine-clicking is not Oriental. The
“bebe” has to be done in pure Japanese.</p>
<p class='c014'>16th—I found a hammock on the veranda.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is the thing for summer, of course.</p>

<p class='c009'>I never laid me in it before in my life.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought that I would see how I would feel.</p>

<p class='c009'>I hanged it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I romped in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was delightful. I fancied that we—I and
who?—hammocked among the summer
breezes. Then a star appeared. He said,
“How beautiful the star is!”</p>

<p class='c009'>What did I fancy next?</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, never mind!</p>

<p class='c009'>I tossed my feet. The skirt fluttered. My
new satin slippers—number one and a half—were
all seen. I drew up my skirt a little, and
made a whole show of my honourable legs.</p>

<p class='c009'>I prayed that somebody would pass by to
fling an adoring glance at them.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one roamed along. I scorned my
frivolity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Bible by me wasn’t open at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>I decided to read it to-day, although religion
isn’t so becoming.</p>

<p class='c009'>My Bishop sent it this morning. Dear old
Bishop! He thought me quite a docile
“nenne.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I stretched my body in the hammock.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas, ma!</p>

<p class='c009'>My hana kanzashi with the butterflies was
caught by the meshes. The wings of one
butterfly were tortured. Yes, I had put a
Japanese pin on my hair this morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>I hoped I could pay a bit more attention to
my head all the time.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was sad for a while.</p>

<p class='c009'>17th—Good Annie wrote me from Mrs.
Willis’.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a scrawl!</p>

<p class='c009'>But woman’s bad grammar and infirm penmanship
are pathetic, don’t you think so?</p>

<p class='c009'>It might look better on a thin blue tablet.</p>

<p class='c009'>But poor Annie chose such thick smooth
paper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oya! What?</p>

<p class='c009'>A five-dollar check?</p>

<p class='c009'>My goodness, I had forgotten all about my
lottery! Even the ticket I have lost. It
drew out five dollars.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why not thirty thousand dollars?</p>

<p class='c009'>It was better than a blank, anyway, I said
philosophically.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now let me send a little present to my home!</p>

<p class='c009'>A little thing is a deal sweeter.</p>

<p class='c009'>I ordered fourteen packets of N. Y. Central
Park lawn seed from a nursery.</p>

<p class='c009'>New York Central Park!</p>

<p class='c009'>Doesn’t it sound grand?</p>

<p class='c009'>And other flower seeds also.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dwarf sweet pea is named “Cupid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be no wonder if my father mistakes
it for a kibisho.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cupid is a handsome boy, not a bullfrog-looking
teapot, funny papa!</p>

<p class='c009'>He is garden crazy. I can imagine how
conceited he will be showing around his
western sea flowers when they are in bloom.</p>

<p class='c009'>I asked my uncle to translate the directions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Isn’t it handy to keep a secretary?</p>

<p class='c009'>I’ll not miss signing my name on the translation.</p>

<p class='c009'>My daddy may think it was done by myself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Woman is a snob.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now what for mamma?</p>
<p class='c014'>18th—Mother Schuyler took me to her
church.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a heathen me!</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt that I was “sitting on needles,” when
I slipped into the Meriken church without
glancing at even one page of the Bible. It
was as risky a venture as to face an examination
before fitting.</p>

<p class='c009'>The service hadn’t begun.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many ladies were introduced to me by Mrs.
Schuyler.</p>

<p class='c009'>They talked about—what?—anything but
religion.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was fanned continually by an offensive
odor. Some one had left her perfume at
home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Honourable arm-pit smell!</p>

<p class='c009'>Amerikey cultivates many a disagreeable
sort of thing, doubtless.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ladies seemed to regard the church as
another drawing parlor.</p>

<p class='c009'>My mind was calmed within ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ureshiya!</p>

<p class='c009'>The Meriken church is not a difficult place
at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>A Japanese church is ever so sad-faced.
No woman under thirty is seen there. I
laughed at the thought of an “incense-smelling”
young girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>Isn’t it strange that Meriken girls love the
church?</p>

<p class='c009'>Is it because they cannot marry without it?</p>

<p class='c009'>Sunday amusement doesn’t begin before
noon. What would girls do if there were no
church where they could burst into song?</p>

<p class='c009'>How classically the bald head of the minister
shone!</p>

<p class='c009'>There is nothing more pleasing than a
sweeping sermon on a bright day.</p>

<p class='c009'>But my mind strayed, wondering why all
those ladies were so homely.</p>

<p class='c009'>I snatched my hat off, wishing to be different
from the rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>I fancied the reason why their hats were
eternally glued to their heads was because
their hair was never in first-rate order for exhibition.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many years ago I used to steal into a Buddha
temple, being a little “otenba,” and tap an
idol’s shoulder, saying: “How are you getting
along, Hotoke Sama?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not one idol here!</p>

<p class='c009'>No incense!</p>

<p class='c009'>How uninteresting!</p>

<p class='c009'>How silly I was inventing some clever thing
for the occasion when I should be forced to
confess! The church was not Catholic.</p>

<p class='c009'>When we returned home, Mrs. Schuyler
asked me what was the text.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me see——”</p>

<p class='c009'>I made as if I had been a listener to the
sermon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear Mrs. Schuyler, what was it?” I exclaimed
as if I had accidentally forgotten.</p>
<p class='c014'>19th—Miss Olive offered to show me how
to play golf.</p>

<p class='c009'>I went to her home at Pasadena.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pasadena is a luxurious Winter resort of
cheerful aspect.</p>

<p class='c009'>Its water is blessed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the street cars run like a well-bred
gentleman. The dog never growls around.
It only wags its tail. No beggars.</p>

<p class='c009'>America’s outdoor diversion demands a
great deal of strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>What an imbecile “anego!”</p>

<p class='c009'>After fifteen minutes I found two bean-like
blisters on each palm.</p>

<p class='c009'>I gave up the game.</p>

<p class='c009'>I bought a golf outfit, nevertheless, in a
store on my way home. The sight of a lady
carrying it once stamped itself on my mind as
so charming.</p>

<p class='c009'>What attire would be becoming to me?</p>

<p class='c009'>I said that my waist should be of deep red
wool. Skirt? It must also be of wool, of
course, with a large checkerboard pattern.
Silk isn’t gamesome, is it? And the hat
should be a mouse-coloured felt, which must be
thrust carelessly by my big gold pin with a
coral head.</p>

<p class='c009'>I well-nigh decided to dye my hair red.</p>

<p class='c009'>What will my uncle say?</p>
<p class='c014'>20th—Schuyler’s cook wasn’t acquainted
with the art of rice-cooking.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mother Schuyler said explanatorily that she
had never tasted properly cooked rice since
the day at Yokohama.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rice was pasty.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought I would boil the rice according to
Japanese prescription for to-day’s dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>I stepped down to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>I put three cupfuls of rice in a saucepan,
and dipped my hand in it, and supplied water
as much as to my wrist.</p>

<p class='c009'>I placed it on the splendid fire till the
agitated water pushed up the lid. Then I
moved it on to a gentle fire. The cooking
was done after twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was honoured by everybody at the dinner.
The rice was singularly fine. The grains
kept their own perfect shapes.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the dinner I approached Mrs. Schuyler
with ink and paper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you write your recommendation of
my rice-cooking?” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>She gazed at me questioningly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a funny girl! What shall I say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I dictated solemnly thus:</p>

<p class='c019'>“<i>To whom it may concern:</i></p>

<p class='c020'>“I highly recommend Miss Morning
Glory with her honourable art of rice-cooking.
Her method is Japanese, that is to say, the
best in the world.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Schuyler</span>”</p>
<p class='c014'>21st:—Without a nephew Mother Schuyler
wouldn’t be a complete old dear.</p>

<p class='c009'>She has one fortunately.</p>

<p class='c009'>Olive San told me a whole lot about her
great brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>He is a promising artist.</p>

<p class='c009'>Artist?</p>

<p class='c009'>Doesn’t an artist affect boorish hair? I was
anxious to know how his hair was, because I
hated anything long except a frock-coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Olive declared him one handsome boy.
(I thought how ridiculous is the American girl
to praise her brother. It is Japanese etiquette
to undervalue one’s relatives in describing
them.)</p>

<p class='c009'>I finished my imaginary sketch of his face
before we intruded in his studio.</p>

<p class='c009'>Olive presented me to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a comely young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>What gratified me most about him was his
shapely shoes, well-polished.</p>

<p class='c009'>He knew how to talk with girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was instantly put on unceremonious terms.</p>

<p class='c009'>How beautifully he once slipped “Miss” in
addressing me! His gracefully-sounding
“Pardon me, I mean Miss Morning Glory!”
pleased me enormously.</p>

<p class='c009'>I told him that it was a regular humbug to
be particular.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will call you Oscar, shall I?” I said,
winking.</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt some fervid water oozing down my
cheeks. I was blushing.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was glad that he was not Mr. Ellis, Jr.
The word “Jr.” appears to me like a ragged
papa’s old coat which is dreadfully out of
fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you let me paint you?” he requested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am I beautiful enough, do you think?”
I said, dropping my eyelids.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only too charming!” he said bravely.</p>

<p class='c009'>I always think every gentleman whom I
meet falls in love with me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I regarded Mr. Oscar Ellis already as an
adorer.</p>

<p class='c009'>O sentimental Morning Glory!</p>

<p class='c009'>When I returned to Schuyler’s my mind
was completely occupied with an absurd fancy.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was thinking what I shall do when he
proposes to me. Shall I say yes?</p>

<p class='c009'>For a girl to fall in love with one while she
is staying at his aunt’s isn’t romantic a bit, is
it?</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t care, anyhow, for an artist lover.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a worn-out hero in old fiction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Doesn’t the word “artist” ring like a
synonym for poverty?</p>
<p class='c014'>22nd—Mrs. Ellis invited me to dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>I went to Pasadena with Mrs. Schuyler, Jr.</p>

<p class='c009'>The evening was fragrant.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the dinner we stepped out to the
garden. It was dusky.</p>

<p class='c009'>By and by, twenty Japanese lanterns were
candled among the trees in my honor.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was in a sprightly bent.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was whispering a little Jap song, when
Oscar led out two donkeys.</p>

<p class='c009'>Olive sprang upon the back of one in
gracious audacity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jump, Morning Glory!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was wavering about my action, when I felt
Oscar’s firm arms around my waist. My
small body was lifted on to the donkey’s by
his careless gallantry.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a sensation ran through me! It was
the first occasion to put me into so close
contact with a Meriken young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>My skirt was caught by the saddle. I made
a whole exhibition of my leg.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I was glad the stocking was beautiful.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oscar held my bridle, pacing by my side.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas!</p>

<p class='c009'>My donkey acted awfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>Did he take it as a degradation to be
whipped by a Jap?</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly it dropped its honourable rump.
I should have been pitifully thrown out, if my
arm had not seized Oscar’s neck. I looked
apologetically at him. He turned his delighted
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>I could not stay a minute longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I got me off from the donkey, I
observed the new moon over my right shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good luck!” Olive San said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why?</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Oscar began to whistle somewhat as
follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ho pop pop pop, ho pop pop pa!”</p>
<p class='c014'>23rd—To-day is Mrs. Schuyler’s reception
day.</p>

<p class='c009'>She set two Japanese screens in the drawing
room, moving them from her chamber.
She sprinkled a great lot of exotic bric-a-bric
about.</p>

<p class='c009'>She opened a regular Chinese bazar which
expressed every poor taste. Such confusion!</p>

<p class='c009'>I fancied she wanted the callers to recollect
that she was Mrs. Ex-Consul of the Orient.</p>

<p class='c009'>Japan teaches nothing but simplicity.
Simplicity is the philosophy of art.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wondered how she lived there without
learning it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every inch of Schuyler’s parlour means a
heap of money.</p>

<p class='c009'>But is there anything more displeasing than
tasteless luxury? Sufficiency is grateful, but
superfluity is nothing but offence.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought that Americans buy things because
they love to buy, not because they have
to buy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meriken jin has to study the high art of
concealing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The brown people look upon the scattering
of things (however costly they be) as lower
than barbarity. Japs believe in the sublimity
of space.</p>

<p class='c009'>Isn’t it delightful to sit on the new matting
of a Japanese guest-room? Its fresh whiteness
used to cure my headache.</p>

<p class='c009'>Isn’t it taste to place just one seasonable
picture on the tokonoma?</p>

<p class='c009'>So many a Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Smith called.</p>

<p class='c009'>They surrounded me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I asked myself whether they paid a visit to
Mother Schuyler or to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>They incessantly threw the following questions
at me:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you like America?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How long do you expect to stay?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Such an inquisitive Meriken woman!</p>

<p class='c009'>I wished I had been bright enough to print
a slip with my reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each lady wore four rings at least.</p>

<p class='c009'>Are they real things?</p>

<p class='c009'>Diamond is hardly my choice. Haughtily
cold, isn’t it?</p>

<p class='c009'>I declared that their shapeless fingers were
not fit to show without embellishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>If I had money for a ring I would use it for
365 pairs of silk stockings. Isn’t it a joy to
change every day?</p>

<p class='c009'>Schuyler’s baby made a hit with its kimono.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the ladies kissed and kissed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The baby wondered at their act, rolling its
eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mother Schuyler was quite fussy with a
little speech about the history of its Japanese
gown.</p>

<p class='c009'>Funny old dear!</p>
<p class='c014'>24th—Mr. Oscar Ellis came to paint me.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dear Oscar!</p>

<p class='c009'>I have never before left my face alone for
such a close scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was restless at first, fancying that he was
gathering all my flaws.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then it happened in my thought that his
absorption had something of religious devotion
in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I grew easy.</p>

<p class='c009'>I began to feel like a star with all the admirers
in the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>A garden tree sent its shadow through the
window. The time passed as gracefully as a
fairy on tiptoe. The air was purple.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oscar San chatted freely.</p>

<p class='c009'>I never took the part of a listener before in
my life. I found listening honourable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you like the Oriental woman?” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>He said American beauty was rather external,
like a street shop window. He would
like to know, he said, if there was any word
more pathetic than “sayonara.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t the Japanese woman like it?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought he was correct.</p>

<p class='c009'>He continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I read in a modern poet the following
lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘ .... full of whispers and of shadows,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou art what all the winds have uttered not,</div>
      <div class='line'>What the still night suggesteth to the heart.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Such is the vague Japanese beauty in my
idea.”</p>
<p class='c009'>“I am not so nobly sweet, am I?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>He cast a strong look, as if he were trying
to put his final judgment upon me.</p>

<p class='c009'>He moved his brush slowly on the canvas.</p>

<p class='c009'>I bowed a profound bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gomen kudasai!” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>And I laid me on the floor, stretching out
my legs.</p>
<div id='i128'  class='figcenter id009'>

<p><span class='small'><i>Drawn by Genjiro Yeto</i></span><br />“<span class='sc'>So you like the Oriental woman?</span>”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'>25th—I bought two dolls.</p>

<p class='c009'>One for Schuyler’s baby, as my Christmas
gift.</p>

<p class='c009'>I slept with the other last night. I
squeezed my ear to the dolly, fancying I might
hear a few scratches of human voice. I kissed
it. I laughed, saying that the doll was the
thing for my starting to learn how to kiss.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sleep till mamma comes back, darling!”
I said in the morning when I stepped down for
my breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>I left the table before I had half-finished, on
account of my anxiety lest the upstairs girl
might tattle of my childishness, if she found
the doll in my bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thank Heavens!</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl hadn’t come around yet.</p>

<p class='c009'>I locked it up in my trunk.</p>

<p class='c009'>What name shall I give it?</p>

<p class='c009'>Charley?</p>

<p class='c009'>I was disgusted at the thought, because
every Chinee—ten thousand Mongols in all—is
named one Charley.</p>

<p class='c009'>Merry Christmas, all of you!</p>
<p class='c014'>26th—It rained.</p>

<p class='c009'>I implored Mother Schuyler to select a book
from her library.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the literature was packed in there, beginning
with Socrates, sane as a silver dollar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every book was without finger-marks.
Book without finger-mark is like bread without
brown crust. Dear finger-mark!</p>

<p class='c009'>The fashion is to buy books and to glance
at their covers, I suppose, but not to read
them. Modern publications aren’t meant to
be read, are they? The authors have degenerated
to the place of upholsterers. Isn’t it a
shame?</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Schuyler picked out for me “Rubaiyat
of Omar Khayyam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle said: “American woman can’t
keep away from Omar and chicken-salad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I began to peruse it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The raindrops by my window tuned:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tap, tap, tip, tap, tap!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I thumped the book on the floor, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Khayyam!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Rubaiyat is a menace against civilisation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Americanism is nothing but the delight in
life and the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wonder why the wise government of
Washington does not oppose its pagan circulation.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is leprosy.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I thought how truly true was his “I
came like Water, and like Wind I go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I took up the book and opened it again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I shut it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I listened to the “Tap, tap, tip!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Doesn’t it sound like a wan voice of Omar?</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes!</p>
<p class='c014'>27th—A lady whom I met at Mrs. Schuyler’s
reception sent me a mass of distinguished
roses.</p>

<p class='c009'>Loving American!</p>

<p class='c009'>I said I would arrange them in Japanese
cult.</p>

<p class='c009'>My style is the enshin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Amerikey is destitute of flowers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nippon is known as a paradise of botanists.
The “scientists” of flower decoration (if I
may call them so) are given a great advantage
in their craft of delineating beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rose is not much of a flower to the Jap
mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>They never employ it in their work. It
has no grace of line. Its perfume cannot indemnify
for its being thorny. Things not
qualified to convey charm are declined from
the tokonama.</p>

<p class='c009'>I love roses awfully well myself.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will make the best of them in my art.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is there any proper vase in Schuyler’s
house?</p>

<p class='c009'>Mother Schuyler fetched me two pieces.</p>

<p class='c009'>One was a silver vase and the other a china
one.</p>

<p class='c009'>I couldn’t use them, I was sorry. Silver
was commercial-looking. The painting on the
china a hodge-podge of a joss house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I was seized with a thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>I ran down to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>I borrowed an old scrubbing bucket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such a soft antique hue!” I exclaimed
with delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>I elected one imperial rose and one little
one for a “retainer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I fixed them in the bucket.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought it was verily the simplicity of the
illustrious Mr. Rikiu.</p>

<p class='c009'>I presented the rest of the roses to Mrs.
Schuyler, Jr.</p>

<p class='c009'>She stared at the bucket without a word. I
knew that her silence was the most forcible
irony. She didn’t approve of setting such a
bucket on the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Meriken jins don’t know any art!” I said,
when she left.</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle begged me not to act so fantastically.</p>
<p class='c014'>28th—“Here’s a shamisen, Morning
Glory!” Mother Schuyler cried from the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>I darted out of my room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shamisen?</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a three-stringed guitar of Japan.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Schuyler, Jr., had sent it from Yokohama,
as she explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>She wished me to tinkle a little gamboling
music in the parlour before dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a hard implement to handle. It has
no notation. Attainment is through unending
blind practice.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was compelled to learn by mother, many
a year ago, but I soon gave it up for an English
spelling-book.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I daresay I can play.</p>

<p class='c009'>I regulated the key to begin with.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ting, ting! Chang, Chang, ting!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What to hum, Uncle?” I asked, facing
aside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Love ditty is desirable,” Oji San considered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t fancy me a geisha!” I said in defending
laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I murmured an old hauta, “Haori kakushite,”
which was Englished by some one.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She hid his coat,</div>
      <div class='line'>She plucked his sleeve,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘To-day you cannot go!</div>
      <div class='line'>To-day, at least, you will not leave,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The heart that loves you so!’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The mado she undid</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And back the shoji slid:</div>
      <div class='line'>And clinging cried, ‘Dear Lord, perceive</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The whole world is snow!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>29th—We went to a theatre last evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dear, classical “flower path”!</p>

<p class='c009'>How I missed it in the Meriken stage!</p>

<p class='c009'>Flower path?</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a projection into the auditorium used
to represent when one starts out of the house
or returns.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the American stage has no front gate
scene! Every one enters very likely from the
kitchen door.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stage never turns round like the Japanese
stage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, dear, iyadawa!</p>

<p class='c009'>American play has too much kissing. Each
time I was electrified.</p>

<p class='c009'>The pit was filled with a well-behaved throng.
All the ladies took off their hats. Do they pay
more respect than in church? The gentlemen
never whiffed smoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>Japan theatre is a hurly-burly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The “boys” roar up “Honourable tea—O’cha
wa yoroshi? Honourable cake?” The attendants
of tea houses bow around to the beneficent
habitues, like inclining puppets.</p>

<p class='c009'>Women sob. They laugh, stuffing their
sleeves into their mouths. They are ready to
put themselves in the play. They are sentimental.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meriken women place themselves above the
play.</p>

<p class='c009'>I doubted whether they were criticising or
enjoying.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some lady even used a spy-glass to examine
the face of a player.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought it decidedly an impertinence.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a pry!</p>

<p class='c009'>I will not act to such an assembly, if I ever
happen to be an actress.</p>

<p class='c009'>What was the title of the play?</p>

<p class='c009'>I could hardly understand half of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I tried hard to swallow my gape.</p>
<p class='c014'>30th—Mr. Oscar Ellis came to put the finishing
touch to my picture.</p>

<p class='c009'>The execution was subtle sureness.</p>

<p class='c009'>He said that he would offer it to his beloved
aunty—Mother Schuyler, of course—begging
to let it ornament the wall of my room.</p>

<p class='c009'>My room?</p>

<p class='c009'>It is “my room” for a few days yet.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought it exceedingly sweet.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wall is duskily red. The effect would
be superb.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I announced to him that our leave
would take place on the approaching fourth, he
started as if he had received a stroke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So soon?” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” I said, turning my uneasy face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are only beginning to understand each
other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am a bird of passage, as you know. I
have to fly on my road.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The air grew tragic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Oscar said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What will you do when you tire of flying?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sah!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll return to Los Angeles and induce you
to marry me with my honourable Oriental oratory.
Will that do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>We interchanged our nimble look. We
laughed afterward.</p>

<p class='c009'>After he left Schuyler’s, I said to myself
that I would not mind positively if he would
kiss me. The kiss must be on my brow, however.
Lips are too personal.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wrote a note, beseeching him not to forget
to kiss me at my farewell.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I chewed the note.</p>

<p class='c009'>I reviled my folly.</p>
<p class='c014'>31st—Street walking is a delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>I’ll mirror my face in the glass of the shop
windows ambling by.</p>

<p class='c009'>I dropped a handkerchief to-day.</p>

<p class='c009'>A gentle gentleman—man behind me should
be young and good looking always—picked it
up. His respectful “Pardon me—” made me
feel as if I were living in the silver-armoured
age of chivalry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shall I drop something again?</p>

<p class='c009'>I observed a variety of form in raising the
skirt.</p>

<p class='c009'>One lifted a bit of the left by her finger-tips.
Another pulled up the right edge of her front.
Another clinched out the centre of her back,
showing a significant fist. A corpulent one
stepped, holding up both sides of her front.
The miserable underskirt revealed itself in red.</p>

<p class='c009'>Which mode is becoming to me?</p>
<p class='c014'>Jan. 1st, 1900—Is to-day the opening of
another century?</p>

<p class='c009'>Happy New Year!</p>

<p class='c009'>I will send a lot of “Shinnen omedeto” to
Tokio.</p>

<p class='c009'>Isn’t this a queer New Year?</p>

<p class='c009'>No shimenawa along the façades with flitting
gohei!</p>

<p class='c009'>No “gate pine tree”!</p>

<p class='c009'>No sambow for an oblation unto the gods in
any room!</p>

<p class='c009'>No rice-bread! No golden toso for the cup!</p>

<p class='c009'>I mingled with a neighbour’s girls for a
“rope-jumping.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We played hide-and-seek. I offered ten
cents reward to the one who detected me. I
abandoned the unprofitable job after emptying
out all my change.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Olive called on a bicycle.</p>

<p class='c009'>I persuaded her to let me try on her bloomers.
She exchanged them for my walking skirt
which was four inches shorter.</p>

<p class='c009'>We hurried to the garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>She helped me on the wheel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a bad Meriken girl!</p>

<p class='c009'>She slipped her hand from it. I fell on a
bush. The touchy rose thorned in my hand.</p>
<p class='c014'>2nd—I made a discovery.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mother Schuyler’s teeth are all false.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have no chance to explore whether her
hair is a wig.</p>

<p class='c009'>She chains a big bunch of keys to her waist.
Its rattle sounds housewifely.</p>

<p class='c009'>She forgot it, laying it on the sitting-room
table.</p>

<p class='c009'>I knotted it to my waist-strap.</p>

<p class='c009'>I jiggled it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jaran, jaring, jaran, jaran!”</p>
<p class='c014'>3rd—The sayonara dinner was given. Mrs.
Ellis’ folks joined us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mother Schuyler repeated every ten minutes
her query, “when would I visit them again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Oscar set his depressive look on me.
I wasn’t brave enough to encounter it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I slid away from confronting him.</p>

<p class='c009'>I found him an elegant young man. He
impressed me as an image of Apollo.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only God knows when I will reprint my
footsteps on the soil of Los Angeles!</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt awfully sorry in leaving such an
agreeable company.</p>

<p class='c014'>4th—Good-bye, Mr. Parrot!</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>San Francisco</span>, 5th.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am again at Mrs. Willis’.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such miraculous San Francisco water!</p>

<p class='c009'>I will taste bliss again in drinking the
midnight water, stretching out my arm from
the bed.</p>
<p class='c014'>6th—I tied Dorothy’s hair in Nippon style.</p>

<p class='c009'>She pleased me much by remembering the
Japanese words I taught her.</p>

<p class='c009'>She is a cute dear.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mode had been the “O’tabaco bon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I straightened her hair with my wet hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>I added a tiny bit of crimson crape.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked a lovely fairy.</p>
<p class='c014'>7th—Rainy day!</p>

<p class='c009'>The heavily reserved weather confines me
in the pose of genius.</p>

<p class='c009'>My hair lounged down my shoulders.
Disorder is the first step in being a genius, I
fancy. My eyes should be rolled up to the sky
in divine tragicalness.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have had a greediness for the name of
novelist.</p>

<p class='c009'>To-day I found myself in the crisis where I
must scribble or die.</p>

<p class='c009'>I regret to say that mine is a love story also,
as every beginner’s book has been. I hope
everybody will be contented with “The
Destiny,” a respectable title for my fiction.
Who says it is the style of name employed one
hundred years ago?</p>

<p class='c009'>The book will be concluded with three hundred
pages.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now I wonder whether a long story is in
demand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Chapter I, is as follows:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>WHEN THE MOON ROSE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This story begins when the moon rose.</p>

<p class='c009'>Its silvery rays—it was six P.M. of April—fell
on the Shiba park in laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>My heroine jogged along into the park,
singing a light song.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Miss Honourable Moon, how old are you?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thirteen and seven, you say?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>You are young enough to marry——”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Let me explain about her a bit!</p>

<p class='c009'>Her name is O Hana San.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thirteen years old. Thirteen? It is the
age when the flower of girlhood starts to bloom.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bewitching Hana!</p>

<p class='c009'>Do you remember a well by the glorious
cherry tree in the park? The ’rikisha men
moisten their parched lips at the “Heaven-Sent.”
That is its name, sir.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Hana looked down into the well.</p>

<p class='c009'>She began to adjust her hair. The first
worry of a girl after thirteen would naturally
be about her hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>She gazed up to the cherry blossoms and
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Utsukushii nah! Lovely!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she found her face again in the well-mirror,
thinking what a charming O Hana San
it would make with the flowers on her hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>My worthy readers, I suppose it is the time
some one must enter.</p>

<p class='c009'>He came.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a little boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will not mention his name just yet.</p>

<p class='c009'>He came close to her and pinched her little
back. Both blushed, facing each other.
They were quite strangers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The evening zephyrs stirred the cherry
blossoms. They planted themselves silently
among the falling petals, as ethereal as snow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I delight to stand in the storm of petals,
don’t you?” Hana inclined her head a trifle
in speaking.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman always speaks first.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me see your school book!” again she
said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He put it in her tiny hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks! Arigato!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She bowed low. When she put the book
on her shoulder, she was running away, singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Miss Honourable Moon, how old are you?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The boy stood aghast.</p>
<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The author of this story found O Hana
San again by the same well on the next
evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy’s book in her hand, of course.</p>

<p class='c009'>She paced around the well, muttering:</p>

<p class='c009'>“He must come, because the moon rose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But he was not seen.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>My next chapter will be “The Second
Meeting.”</p>
<p class='c014'>8th—My precious Ada again!</p>

<p class='c009'>How could I live without her?</p>

<p class='c009'>We hastened to a circus.</p>

<p class='c009'>If I were a boy, I could earn a heap of
money selling “Pea—nuts! Lemon—ade!”</p>

<p class='c009'>How those clowns did tumble!</p>

<p class='c009'>If I could share in such fun!</p>

<p class='c009'>The ringmaster was the handsomest man in
the world, in shiny boots and heavenly hat.
How splendidly his whip cracked!</p>

<p class='c009'>The clack dashed like a burst of bamboo.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wouldn’t you be glad to be the lady on
horseback? I would truly. Glance at her
daring grace!” I whispered to Miss Ada.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the seal performed.</p>

<p class='c009'>We laughed till tears dropped.</p>

<p class='c009'>The circus had twenty elephants. Think!</p>

<p class='c009'>Our Imperial Menagerie of Tokio has only
one. How poor!</p>
<p class='c014'>9th—Last night I went over to Mrs. Consul’s
to be given a lesson in card-playing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cribbage would be the thing. Why?
Because the Lambs took much pleasure in it,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is poker?” I suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gambling game!” she protested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I delight in gambling, Mrs. Consul,” I
proclaimed.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>I had a wicked dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>What do you imagine?</p>

<p class='c009'>I ran away with a circus rider.</p>
<p class='c014'>10th—I made the acquaintance of a Japanese
woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>She must have been passing her thirty
springs. I could be accurate in my scale, being
one of her sisterhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>A cigar-stand keeper in Dupont Street.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her name is O Fuji San.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Wistaria brought a box of cigarettes
that my uncle had ordered.</p>

<p class='c009'>The morning is unoccupied in such a retail
shop. Nobody puffs much before lunch. She
set herself in a tête-à-tête.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chastity of a wife may be measured by
her solo on her husband. Woman’s greatest
joy often lies in lamenting the faults of her
teishu.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Wistaria spoke of her husband’s being
ill. I was to accept any chance for squandering
my feelings. I sympathised, repeating,
“Komaru nei! How sad!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She said that she was going to leave the
city for a week for the spring of San Jose, to
take care of her infirm dear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I fear I may lose my customers,” she
flagged.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her husband was afflicted with rheumatism.</p>

<p class='c009'>I promised to call at her store.</p>

<p class='c009'>Japs never visit an invalid without a present.</p>

<p class='c009'>Champagne? It’s too ostentatious a drink.
It’s like a highly rouged woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>The loving-eyed claret should be chosen.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sent half a dozen bottles to Mrs. Wistaria’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>A charity woman should be dressed in black
and white. I went to Dupont street, however,
in my grey dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her husband struggled to entertain me.
His clumsy smile appeared all the time at the
wrong cue.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Mr. What’s-his-name!</p>

<p class='c009'>Their business was an absurdly small affair.</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole stock hardly valued above one
hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought I could conduct it rightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was carried away by a sudden fancy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t you leave your store in my hands,
while you are away? Say yes! No?” I
pressed myself upon them eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were amazed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“High-born lady like you? Oh, no! Doshite,
doshite! Think! Do you know this is
the toughest part of the town?” Mrs. Wistaria
tried to make me retreat.</p>

<p class='c009'>I couldn’t listen to her, my whole soul being
absorbed in my new caprice.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought it remarkably romantic.</p>

<p class='c009'>I left the store to bring uncle to talk the
matter over.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Wistaria’s store was neighboured by
every saloon. The fuddling sounds overflowed
in song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hello ma baby, hello ma honey——”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>11th—Now he is my beloved uncle.</p>

<p class='c009'>He assured me of his help in carrying out
my freak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are fitting me for a slightly better
rôle, I fancy,” he said, venturing to add even
one or two of his good-natured giggles. “The
secretaryship of a cigar-stand is a rather more
hopeful occupation than carrying your wraps
through the street.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything was arranged.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Wistaria and her husband set off for
San Jose.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am a merchant-lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first thing I did was to put up a dignified
sign with the following black letters:</p>
<div class='bodoni'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div><span class='xxlarge'>MORNING GLORY CIGAR STORE.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c014'>I borrowed a picture from Mrs. Willis’ parlour,
and placed it by the slot machine.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is the picture of a dear Injun sitting
against a woodland fire with a respectable pipe,
whose smoke sails up to the yellow moon.
What resignation! What dream! What joy!
It did suit beautifully for the cigar-stand.</p>

<p class='c009'>I love to see a man smoking. The elfish
smoke acts like a merry-hearted May gossamer.
When I observe a man’s eye pursuing his
smoke, I say to myself that his soul must be
stepping nearer to his ideal. The road of
smoke is the road of poesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>A noble trade is tobacco.</p>

<p class='c009'>Man’s hermitage is situated only in smoking,
I should say.</p>

<p class='c009'>I divested my uncle of his coat. I begged
him to hold a bucket and a piece of cloth for a
moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you ready to wash the windows,
Uncle?” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Traitor, Morning Glory!” He flashed
his accusing glare.</p>

<p class='c009'>Docile old man!</p>

<p class='c009'>He cleaned four windows of the kitchen,
which was also the dining-room and the parlour.</p>

<p class='c009'>I paid him five cents for each.</p>

<p class='c009'>I said: “It’s good fun to hire the chief
secretary of the Nippon Mining Company to
rub windows, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And I laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I forced him to buy a cigar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You made some twenty cents out of me.
Your turn is coming, my uncle!” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sold him a box of Lillian Russell cigars
for three dollars. The real price was two.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p class='c014'>12th—I invited my precious Ada to my
store to dine <i>à la Japonaise</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>One Jap restaurant catered to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Irrashaimashi! Condescend to enter!”
I showered my wooden-clogged greeting over
Ada.</p>

<p class='c009'>From “The Klondyke,” my neighbouring
saloon, a nigger song was flapping in.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If you ain’t got no money, you needn’t come round.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Happy Ada San!</p>

<p class='c009'>She was about to join in it, when I brought
her into my great dining-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>(Beg pardon, it was a paltry kitchen!)</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything was seen on the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Japanese dinner has no strict order of
courses. You are a frolicsome butterfly
among the dishes set like flowers before you.
You may flit straight to any one which catches
your whim.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take your honourable chop-sticks!” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Miss Ada!</p>

<p class='c009'>“How shall I manage with one stick?” she
raised her eyelids in questioning meekness.</p>

<p class='c009'>I bade her to split the stick in two. It was
a brand new wooden one. I showed her how
to finger it.</p>

<p class='c009'>She nibbled a bit from each dish. Every
time she tasted she looked upon me with a
suspicious smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>And how she slipped her sticks at the critical
moment!</p>

<p class='c009'>The sight amused me hugely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How dare I swallow raw fishes!” she said
shrinking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What delight I taste in them!” I slammed
back at her timidity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I dipped a few cuts of the fishes into
a porcelain soy pan for my mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>I even trampled into her fish-dish by and by.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was literally terrified.</p>

<p class='c009'>The feast was over. I said, “Go yukkuri!
Honourable not-to-be-in-a-hurry!” I slid away.</p>

<p class='c009'>I tied my white apron like a shop girl. I
was glad that I did not forget to push a lead-pencil
through my hair. I presented myself
to Ada carrying a cigarette box.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you buy tobacco for your lord?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I spread the box before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much for one packet,” she asked
with the charming arrogance of a customer.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was acting also.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-day is the memorial day of Lord Nono
Sama. My sweet Oku San, allow me to make
a reduction!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then we laughed.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>13th—I created much noise in the Jap
colony!</p>

<p class='c009'>Why not?</p>

<p class='c009'>Many brown men pause by my store and
buy, simply because they can address a word
or two to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>They are silly, aren’t they?</p>

<p class='c009'>I announce that I am tired of their faces.
I have never met one progressive-seeming
Oriental since I landed. They are like a dry
tree. Are their souls dying?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, that’s why, they have no girl,” my
uncle conclusioned.</p>

<p class='c009'>He is so bright once in a while.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why not make love with Meriken musume?</p>

<p class='c009'>I said I would petition the Tokio government
to transplant her women.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may ruin the Japanese girl’s name, was my
afterthought, if they ship only the homely gang.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lovely girl has no longing to sail over the
ocean. She has plenty of chance to grow a
flower bride at home.</p>

<p class='c009'>I pity my native boys of this city.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jap! Jap!”</p>

<p class='c009'>They are dashed with such exclamations
from every corner.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for me the sound of “Jap” is my taste,
so I spray it in my writing.</p>

<p class='c009'>I took up again my knitting work which I
had commenced on the seas. Nothing could
be more decent to fill up my leisure in the
store.</p>

<p class='c009'>My little neck fell, as I was intent on my
stocking.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some one spoke above my head: “How is
business?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So, so!” I replied in businesslike reserve.</p>

<p class='c009'>I lifted my face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oya, he was Mr. Consul.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you sell me a cigar?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Things are becoming awfully high. Mine
is a distinctly dear store. Do you know it,
Mr. Consul?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m prepared to pay more at the beautiful
girl’s,” he began to titter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“General Arthur cigar has leaped one dollar
higher since Monday, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t mean it!” He mimicked a
sudden alarm.</p>
<p class='c014'>14th—O funny drunkard!</p>

<p class='c009'>To-day one fellow established himself before
my store. He fixed his amazing eyes on my
face, and extended his hairy hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hel-lo, Japanese!” he stuttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>He wanted to shake hands with me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I lengthened my arm, and slapped his face.
I withdrew directly within, and watched him
from a hole.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha, ha! She got mad—ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was in a tip-top state of mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me help myself!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He pilfered one cigar from the shelf. He
struck a match. He bit the cigar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>He tossed himself away with ludicrous dignity,
singing:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pon pili, yon, pon, pon!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is undeniably a tough place!” I exclaimed.</p>
<p class='c014'>15th—Night has just arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only ten minutes ago a white-capped “Jim”
(I overheard people calling him so) lighted a
paper lantern labelled “Tomales.” He is an
eating-stand keeper across the street. The
loafers passed. There was some time to
watch the lazy parade. It was a blank hour
of Saturday when he could puff a whiff of
smoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>The prankish songs ceased.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even in Dupont Street I am given a page
of dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>The barkeeper of “Remember the Maine”
called at my store.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remember the Maine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a name cheap as the grimness of a
toothless woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Barkeeper had something to say, I
imagined.</p>

<p class='c009'>I offered a stem of cigarette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you ever hear a bloody cry at night?”
he began his chapter, gathering a medley of
gravity on his brow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Scream? No!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned aside. I thought he was playing
a threadbare artifice of a story-teller to tantalise
my fancy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me why!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I knew I became his victim.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I fear I do scare you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! I never——” I leaned forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To begin with——”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stopped, looking around.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your kitchen—don’t be scared—is close
by a haunted room of a house on Pine Street.
It’s no story. A chorus girl lived—well, some
five years ago—in that house with her step-mother.
Just think! The old hen of sixty-five
fell in love with her daughter’s lover. Do
you understand? She saw one morning the
young fellow kissing her daughter. She went
crazy. She shot him. Isn’t it awful? The
murderess leaned against the wall by your
kitchen, and cried, ‘I killed him!’ I swear to
you that it is all true. So, people say, a wail
is heard at night from your side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mah! Mah!” I breathed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He retired heavily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do I believe it?</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! No!” I denied.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I was thickly swarmed by sickening air.
How could I trust me in the kitchen!</p>

<p class='c009'>I closed the store.</p>

<p class='c009'>I pasted up a piece of paper whereon was
written: “NO BUSINESS TO-NIGHT.”</p>
<p class='c014'>16th—I had a stomach-ache this morning. I
couldn’t rise.</p>

<p class='c009'>The maid fetched me some toast and a cup
of coffee.</p>

<p class='c009'>I think it is very nice to eat in bed.</p>
<p class='c014'>17th—Mrs. Wistaria and her husband returned
from San Jose.</p>

<p class='c009'>She lavished on me her thousand arigatos.</p>

<p class='c009'>She said I sold sixty per cent more than on
any previous week.</p>

<p class='c009'>She wished me to condescend to accept a
“meagre” fifteen dollars as a share of the
profits.</p>

<p class='c009'>I refused it.</p>
<p class='c014'>18th—My letter to Miss Pine Leaf (who
wept with me reading Keats’ love-letters one
mournful night) is as follows:</p>

<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Matsuba San</span>:</p>

<p class='c021'>‘Hitofude mairase soro.</p>

<p class='c020'>‘I have the honour to present a brief writing.’</p>

<p class='c020'>“Let me omit the shopworn form of Japanese
letter-writing! Its redundant ‘honourables’
are more cheap than honourable.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Satetoya!</p>

<p class='c020'>“Shall I begin my letter with a deep bow?</p>

<p class='c020'>“Bow?</p>

<p class='c020'>“I use it occasionally before Meriken San for
sport’s sake. But it is degenerating, in my
opinion, to comic opera, like the tortoise-shell-framed
spectacles of a Chinese doctor.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Now I address you with a thousand
kisses.</p>

<p class='c020'>“The kiss is the thing to begin with for up-to-date
girls.</p>

<p class='c020'>“It is useful, as a poem is useful in filling up
space in magazine-making. Woman—even a
loftily learned American woman—cannot be
ready always with her rhetoric of expression.
The kiss comes to her relief in the crisis whenever
she fails in speech.</p>

<p class='c020'>“The kiss is everything.</p>

<p class='c020'>“The Jap girl is intimate with the art of
crying.</p>

<p class='c020'>“A kiss is as eloquent as a tear.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I suppose the cleverness of American woman
is graded by the way she handles it. It
strikes me that every white girl is perfectly at
home with it.</p>

<p class='c020'>“She is awfully bright.</p>

<p class='c020'>“You wonder why she is so?</p>

<p class='c020'>“There is one reason that I can tell you. It
is because she has a serious job to pick out
her husband herself. I don’t think it is fair to
blame her growing insipid after marriage.
Every one feels tired when a weighty work is
done. What would be her doom if she were
stupid? An old maid is such a sad sight, like
a broken clock, or a cradle after baby’s death.
Isn’t it dreadful to have nothing to rejoice in
but a customary tea or books? Literary critic
is one occupation left for her. Worse than
death!</p>

<p class='c020'>“I am pained to state that our brown sisters
are extremely behind time.</p>

<p class='c020'>(“There are lots of exceptions, of course, like
honourable you and Miss M. G.)</p>

<p class='c020'>“I am talking of common Jap musumes.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Naturally so.</p>

<p class='c020'>“They are like those waiting at the station
for the next train. They have only to doze
and wait for the footsteps of a matchmaker
with a young man.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I am grateful to the Nippon government
for stimulating education in women.</p>

<p class='c020'>“But I advise her to imprison all the matchmakers.
Then the girls will wake up at once,
like one who has everything on her back after
papa’s passing.</p>

<p class='c020'>“That is one process to brighten them, I
think.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Am I not logical?</p>

<p class='c020'>“Your last tegami questioned me whether the
American lady was charming.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Are you attentive to western sea painting?</p>

<p class='c020'>“How does it impress you when you are
close by it? Only a jumble of paint, isn’t it?
So with Meriken woman!</p>

<p class='c020'>“You should be off half a dozen steps to estimate
her beautiful captivation. You would
be horrified, otherwise, by her hairy skin.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I love her.</p>

<p class='c020'>“She has no headache like the Japs. (By
the way, I will call Japan, hereafter, the country
of headache.) She lives in a comedy.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Nothing turns bad in Amerikey.</p>

<p class='c020'>“‘Tragedy To Be a Woman,’ could only
be seen on a fiction thrown in a moth-trodden
second-hand store.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Police never bother.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Such a deliverance!</p>

<p class='c020'>“I am delighted with my Meriken Kenbutsu.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Sayonara!</p>
<p class='c021'>Yours,</p>
<p class='c023'>“<span class='sc'>Morning Glory</span>”</p>

<p class='c014'>19th—I forced Uncle to swear to me that
he would overlook everything I did, in consideration
of my great service in darning his
socks.</p>

<p class='c009'>I peeled off my shoes to begin with.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sat like a Turk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why do you frown like an Oni in hell?”
I acidified my smile. I held my needle and
thread suspended in the air, while I said:
“What is a Trust?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be quiet!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>He didn’t even glance at me, being engaged
in writing in the other nook.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle, your hair ought to be curled. I
will step in to-morrow morning, and turn it up
before you awake. What do you think,
Uncle? Oji San!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Morning Glory San!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He emitted a growl of satanic despotism,
and soon resumed his work gracefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought what a scandal if he were penning
a love letter to Mrs. Schuyler, junior.</p>

<p class='c009'>I rose. I approached him with secret step.
I fell on him from his massy back and cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you scribbling?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Erai, my honourable uncle!</p>

<p class='c009'>He was translating Gibbon’s “History of
Rome.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was stunned from the shame of taking
him to be in such a wretched line even in
fancy.</p>

<p class='c009'>I vowed to myself—with three low bows—to
take perfect care of my noble worker.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I gave him my sweet smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle, let me fix something more!
Haven’t you anything? Tear your shirt or
pull off the buttons, then!”</p>
<p class='c014'>20th—Already I could suck from the agile
air the flavour of spring upon the lawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was roving by the rose-bushes along the
street with scissors.</p>

<p class='c009'>A gentleman passed by me. How sluggish
his shoes sounded! He stopped, waving
his old-scented smile, and addressed me:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good morning, young lady!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ohayo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I perceive that you are Japanese.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stepped nearer to me. I took a peep
at the Bible under his arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you a Christian?” he lowered his tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you read the Gospel?” his voice
rose higher.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you attend church?” his sound grew
higher still.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I love to be shocked. I couldn’t sustain
myself against a bore. Church? It’s too
sleepy, don’t you know? I have remarked
that God is with me without any sort of
prayer, if I trace the path of righteousness.
A minister is only a meddling grandmamma to
my mind. If I ever build my ideal city, two
things shall not be tolerated. One is a lawyer’s
office and the other is a church. Church, sir!
May I present you with one rose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I raised me to place it in his coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s a letter for you, Morning Glory!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was rescued by my uncle. How angelic
his voice rang!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry, I’m much occupied this very
morning,” I said, bowing slightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>I pushed myself within the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor preacher!</p>
<p class='c014'>21st—My answer to Oscar is as follows:</p>

<p class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Honourable Mr. Ellis:</span></p>
<p class='c025'>“Let me begin in respectable fashion!</p>
<p class='c020'>“A Jap girl is awfully formal.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Do you know, Mr. Ellis, whom you are
addressing?</p>

<p class='c020'>“I am an Oriental.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Nippon daughters believe ‘ev’rithin’ a
gentleman mentions.</p>

<p class='c020'>“They have been fooled enough, I should
declare, in American fiction. Oscar—no, Mr.
Ellis—don’t let me earn the anecdote that I
drifted to Ameriky to be toyed with! My
ancestor did a harakiri. I am pretty sure I
have, then, to kill myself.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Don’t recite again your honourable confession
of love!</p>

<p class='c020'>“It made me cry.</p>

<p class='c020'>“My dark face with drenched eyes will
degrade me to a hired Chinese ‘crying
woman.’</p>

<p class='c020'>“Your narration was dramatic.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Your cleverness is the most lamentable
thing about you. Woman used to love a bright
fellow many years ago. Do you know that
the modern girl woos a stupid man?</p>

<p class='c020'>“Please, don’t repeat again such an adjective
as ‘heavenly’ for my face! No one utters
the word ‘heaven’ except in swearing. Even
ministers juggle with it for a jest in church, I
suppose. My face isn’t heavenly at all. You
know it, don’t you?</p>

<p class='c020'>“You amused me, however, when you told
how you had pillaged my picture from Mother
Schuyler’s room to put in your own, feigning
that it needed to be retouched.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Poor Mother Schuyler!</p>

<p class='c020'>“If she knew your secret!</p>

<p class='c020'>“Frankly, I fear that such a gentleman as
you does commit forgery always. Have you
no consanguinity with a convict?</p>

<p class='c020'>“O such a wretched boy!</p>

<p class='c020'>“The saddest thing about a woman is that
she is glad to fall in love with the worthless.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Do I love you?</p>

<p class='c020'>“Give me time to reply to the question!</p>

<p class='c020'>“Everything is tardy with a Japanese. I
was educated by slowness; I bow one dozen
times before I speak.</p>

<p class='c020'>“O Oscar, you got to think of my side a
little bit!</p>

<p class='c020'>“Every girl claims that she has half a population
as adorers in her pocket handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c020'>“You are the only one young American I
ever met.</p>

<p class='c020'>“If I accept your love, I am afraid one may
satirise my destitution.</p>

<p class='c020'>“You’ll write me soon, won’t you?</p>
<p class='c021'>“Yours, M. G.</p>

<p class='c020'>“P.S.—I wish I could show you how charmingly
I smoke. I learned the art recently. I
tap the cigarette with my middle finger to
knock the ashes off. It is delightful to heap
a hill of ashes on the table edge. When I
puff, finding no word after ‘And—’ the smoke
seems to be speaking for me.</p>

<p class='c020'>“But I assure you that I smoked only before
my uncle.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I was a pretty naughty girl at home, but I
flatter myself that I can easily be classed
among the best in this country.</p>

<p class='c020'>“White women behave terribly, you know.”</p>
<p class='c014'>22nd—I passed the afternoon at Mrs. Consul’s.
She gave me her “favourite” discourse
on Walt Whitman.</p>

<p class='c009'>I delivered to my uncle what I had learned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No newness in it. It is what dear John
Burroughs or Mr. Stedman said.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He overturned my castle with one blow, and
lit his cigar with a victorious air.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was enraged.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes, eraiwa! Oriental gentleman
knows everything we poor women know,” I
said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sulkily drew away to my room with Mr.
Whitman’s fat book, that I borrowed from Mrs.
Consul.</p>
<p class='c014'>23rd—A letter from my father arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Papa, please don’t! I am tired of such
a dirty conference.” I scoffed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I tore the paper into shreds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a sullen lady! What did Otto San
write? Marriage proposal, I reckon!” my
uncle intruded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa threatened me with a list of suitors.
He cried, ‘Chance, chance!’ like the gate-man
of an ennichi show. Pray grant me for
once in my life, Uncle, to say: ‘The marriage
lottery go to the dogs!’ How many Jap
girls kill themselves from the burden of such
a glued union, do you suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, ‘free marriage’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s very beautiful, Miss Morning Glory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are Japanese, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you ever think I was a Meriken jin?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, how did you come to know
young men in a country where familiarity with
one is regarded as a crime for a girl?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Things all wrong in Nippon, Uncle!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry you were born a Jap.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll never go back to Japan, I think. The
dictionary for Jap girls comprises no such
word as ‘No.’ But you must remember,
Uncle, I have the capital ‘No’ in my head.
I am a revolutionist,” I proclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I thought much of my dear Oscar.</p>
<p class='c014'>24th—My worthy labourer upon Gibbon’s
work sat before the table for some hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>I stood behind him and dropped the fluid
from a bottle on his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cold! What are you doing, my little
romp?” He looked up in a fright.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No harm, Uncle! It is only a remedy.
Your hair is growing so thin. Do you know
it? I think it a shame to appear in Greater
New York with a bald gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I bought the bottle this morning.</p>
<p class='c014'>25th—A bamboo table in my room reminded
me of a take bush in the neighbouring
churchyard of my Tokio home.</p>

<p class='c009'>(I cannot sound Meriken jin’s curiosity in
prizing such a cheap thing. The bamboo was
painted. The cross nails glared from everywhere.
I never saw such a Jap work in
Nippon.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Dear take, O bamboo bush!</p>

<p class='c009'>How I used to laugh, breaking the dreams
of sparrows by wriggling the bush!</p>

<p class='c009'>I was so ungoverned.</p>

<p class='c009'>If I could be a grammar school girl again!</p>

<p class='c009'>I secured a reader at a bookstall. My mind
was made up to present myself in the Lincoln
night school and mingle with the girls in
“SEE THE BOY AND THE DOG!”</p>

<p class='c009'>What fun!</p>

<p class='c009'>I went to see the stooping principal. His
tarnished frock-coat—I fancied he was an old
bachelor, as one button was off—was just the
thing for such a <i>rôle</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>I seemed to him a regular nenne of thirteen.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was heartily pleased with my greediness
for learning English.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor soul!</p>

<p class='c009'>He ushered me into the class for which I
had brought the book.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the hour for composition. “Ocean,”
the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I was seated, the girl next me winked
charmingly. She threw me a note within a
minute, to which I promptly replied, “Morning
Glory.” My note was answered “Miss
Madge, 340 Mission Street.” I wrote her,
“May I call on you to-morrow?” for which
she wrote, “As you please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was placed on the dangerous verge of
clapping Byron’s poem into my “Ocean.” I
manufactured one dozen of spelling errors.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You should belong to some higher class.
Take this slip to the principal!” the teacher
said. “You have an imagination.” She wiped
her spectacles slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>I left the room remarking, “Because I am
a Japanese.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I slipped away from the school altogether.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One experience is plenty,” I declared.</p>
<p class='c014'>26th—I went to Mission Street to call on
Madge.</p>

<p class='c009'>From both sides of the street peeped the
famous Jewish noses. The second-hand clothing
shops parade. How droll to see those
noses shrivelling like a lobster!</p>

<p class='c009'>Madge’s father owns a despicable restaurant
with only four eating tables. Mamma cooks,
while she sits on the counter.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I appeared, she shot out, greeting me:
“Hello, Morning Glory!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Awfully glad to see you! I have come to
help you, haven’t I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was ready to strip off my jacket and wind
myself in her apron.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her papa was dumbfounded by my sudden
action.</p>

<p class='c009'>The outside board with the bill of fare was
scraped out by this morning’s rain. It looked
as miserable as an Italian vegetable wagon
under the rain.</p>

<p class='c009'>My first work was to rewrite it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I saw a Jew at a neighbouring door striving
with one about the value of pants. A shoemaker’s
“pan, pan” hammered on my head
from the opposite house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mission Street is the street of horse-dung.</p>

<p class='c009'>When my job was over, an honourable Mr.
Wagon Driver leaped in, bidding me serve
some soup.</p>

<p class='c009'>I ran into the kitchen to fetch it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I spilled it on the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all right, honey!” he said in patronising
aloofness, and pierced my face with
his gummy red eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>O Kowaya! Shocking!</p>

<p class='c009'>I put one five-dollar piece of gold on
Madge’s palm when I left her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Because her shoes were heelless.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pity the musume!</p>
<p class='c014'>27th—I bought one book, being captivated
by its title. Isn’t “When Knighthood was in
Flower” beautifully chivalrous?</p>

<p class='c009'>I have remarked that every Imperial cruiser
anchors at an isle close by Loo Choo, just on
account of the enticement in the name “Come
and See.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I found in my trunk an introduction to Miss
Rose by my professor friend of Tokio ’versity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rose?</p>

<p class='c009'>My imagination started to move like a watch.
I fancied she should be nineteen, since she was
a Miss. No Rose girl can be homely.</p>

<p class='c009'>I went to see her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas!</p>

<p class='c009'>She was a lady like a beer-barrel. Her
finger-nails were black.</p>

<p class='c009'>I left her like a miner stepping out of a gold
mountain with empty hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wonder why the mayor didn’t object to
letting an ugly woman be crowned with a pretty
name.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fifty-years-old Miss Rose!</p>

<p class='c009'>Now I fear to read Mr. Major’s book.</p>
<p class='c014'>28th—The following is my letter to Mr.
Oscar:</p>

<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Oscar San! Ellis San!</span></p>

<p class='c020'>“I never liked your profession, simply because
it is too beautiful.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I don’t see why you cannot transfer to
some other business.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I have been ever so much fascinated with
odd sorts of manual work. If I were a gentleman,
I would very likely pursue the calling of
grave-digger or sea-diver.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Yesterday I passed by some labourers
breaking massive stones. They lifted their
hammers (O Oscar, look at their muscles!)
and knocked them down to the sound of ‘Sara
bagun!’ They jerked the ‘sara bagun,’
Oscar. Does it mean ‘ready?’ Mrs. Willis’
Century dictionary must be imperfect, since
it does not contain such a word. Am I mis-spelling?</p>

<p class='c020'>“Suppose I marry one of those!</p>

<p class='c020'>“He will return home awfully tired. He will
naturally doze after dinner. When his smoking
pipe has slipped from his lips and burned
my best tablecloth, isn’t it possible that I will
be mad?... I startled him, pulling his
hair ever so hard. Now you must think that
he grew mad also. He seized my arm, and
beat me. O Oscar, he beat me surely!...
Then he will repent his conduct, and kneel
by my side, begging my forgiveness. He will
say, ‘My dear sweet wife—’</p>

<p class='c020'>“Do you know how interesting it is to be
beaten by a husband?</p>

<p class='c020'>“I well-nigh fixed my mind never to affiance
with a man too genteel to hit me.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Woman is a revolting little bit of thing.</p>

<p class='c020'>“If you say ‘Yes,’ I am quite ready to slam
my ‘No!’</p>

<p class='c020'>“Oscar San!</p>

<p class='c020'>“I am afraid that you are too amiable.</p>

<p class='c020'>“What you have to do for your next missive
is to collect every kind of dreadful adjectives
from your dictionary, and throw them in.</p>

<p class='c020'>“You know what to do when I get angry,
don’t you?</p>

<p class='c020'>“Ellis San!</p>

<p class='c020'>“You are too handsome.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I am fond of a comely face as anybody
else.</p>

<p class='c020'>“But I fancy often how it would be if I fell
in love with a deformity.</p>

<p class='c020'>“People would laugh at me doubtless. But
how dramatic it would be when I proclaimed,
‘Because I love him!’</p>

<p class='c020'>“What a romantic phrase that is!</p>

<p class='c020'>“Can’t you deform yourself?</p>

<p class='c020'>“Sayonara,</p>
<p class='c021'>“With a thousand bows,</p>
<p class='c023'>“M. G.</p>

<p class='c020'>“P.S.—My letter never finishes without a
P.S.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Isn’t that awful?</p>

<p class='c003'>“My uncle asked me whom I was corresponding
with. I mentioned ‘Olive.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Old man is jealous always.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you got to counterfeit your sister’s penmanship
for your envelope.”</p>
<p class='c014'>29th—I drank the last drop of my coffee.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oji San, when shall we go to New York?”
I said, pillowing my face on my hands on the
breakfast table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As soon as spring begins to flicker in the
East, my little woman! It’s snow and snow
there at present.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I love snow, Uncle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Old gentleman can’t bear tyrannical cold,
Morning Glory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you notice how tired I am of Frisco?
Aren’t you tired?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—frankly!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why don’t you then contrive some novel
diversion to pass a month?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve a fancy, but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It may not strike you as romantic.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am known to one poet who dreams and
erects a stone wall on the hillside. He is unlike
another. His garden and cottage are
open to everybody. I ever incline to loaf in
an irregular puff of odour from his acacia trees.
If you lean towards a poetical life, I have no
hesitation in seeing him to make an arrangement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Uncle, it’s romantic! Is he
married?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because a poet is not one woman’s property,
but universal. My ideal poet is melancholy.
Fat poet is ridiculous. Happy poet
isn’t of the highest order. Tennyson? I
wish his life had been more hard up. I suppose
your friend-poet won’t mind if I sleep all
day. Is he particular about the dinner time?
Does he look up to the stars every night?
Does he wash his shirt once in a while?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I asked respectably:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is the sight from there beautiful?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wonderful! The only place where you
can breathe the air of divinity!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, Uncle. We will settle there,
and hasten to become poets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wouldn’t be a bad idea, I say, to start
again with your honourable ‘Lotos Eaters!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Paradise Lost’ shall be my next subject.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If nobody publishes it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will present it solemnly to our Empress.
She is a poetess, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle went to see Mr. Poet.</p>
<p class='c014'>30th—Uncle said that the poet said: “You
are welcome, sir. The cottage for your young
lady lies by one willow tree. The waters, the
air, the grand view, are God’s. It costs a wee
bit of money to provide the best coffee. I tell
you that my claret is superb. You shall be
my guest as long as you please. Present my
love to Miss Morning Glory! Everything
will be ready when you come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t he adorable?” I ejaculated.</p>

<p class='c009'>I stirred my trunk, and sifted out the things
needful for my adventure.</p>
<p class='c014'>31st—To-morrow!</p>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Heights</span>, Feb. 1st</p>

<p class='c009'>Let me recline heart-to-heart on the breast
of Mother Nature! Let me retreat to a
hillside not far from the city, yet verily near
to God! Let me go to my poet abode!</p>

<p class='c009'>We abandoned the Fruitvale car at the
hill-foot.</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle picked out our destination from
the speckles in the distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The breeze (how heavenly is a country
breeze!) enticed my soul—a Jap girl also is
provided with some soul—into “Far-Beyond.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel myself another girl, Uncle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m a poet already. The poet without
poem is greater, don’t you know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>We climbed the hill slowly. Every step
enlarged the spectacle.</p>

<p class='c009'>When we attained to one wildly well-kept
garden, the whole bay of the Golden Gate
stretched before us. A thousand villages
knelt humbly like vassals.</p>

<p class='c009'>I saw a tiny gate with the sign:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“Fruit Grower.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>An old gentleman appeared from a cottage,
singing.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Poet!” Uncle whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let me now examine him!</p>

<p class='c009'>What lengthy hair he wore!</p>

<p class='c009'>It didn’t annoy me, however, because he
stamped himself on my mind as if he were an
ancient statue. I imagined him a type of
mediæval squire. I thought of him truly as
one metamorphosed from the frontispiece of a
wholly forgotten volume in a cobwebbed recess
of a library.</p>

<p class='c009'>His courteous voice was simply dignified.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nature never hurries. God commands
you every happiness and all repose. Here’s
your little home, my gentle lady! I am at
your service any time. I hope you will find it
comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He set me at the “Willow Cottage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He slipped gracefully away.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was some time before I heard his
“kotsu kotsu” on my door.</p>

<p class='c009'>I opened it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Greeting from the host!” Mr. Heine
offered me a tuft of brisk roses.</p>

<p class='c009'>Heine was the poet’s name.</p>

<p class='c009'>How loving!</p>

<p class='c009'>I buried myself in the thought of straying
to a fairy isle, and being accepted romantically
by the dwellers.</p>

<p class='c009'>I suspected that I was dreaming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Arcadia!” I exclaimed, when the poet
announced that supper would be prepared
within half an hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>I spied him through the window, gathering
the loppings of trees and leaves. He made a
camp-fire. Its soft smoke surged into the sky.
Oh, smell it!</p>

<p class='c009'>How fascinating is the Poet’s life!</p>

<p class='c009'>I ran out, crying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray, make me useful!”</p>
<p class='c014'>2nd—Dream and reality are not marked
here by different badges. They waltz round.
Dear poet home!</p>

<p class='c009'>Was it in my dream that I heard the tinkle
of bells?</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought something was going on.</p>

<p class='c009'>I parted from the bed. I pushed out my
face from the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>Look at the procession of cows!</p>

<p class='c009'>I have read much of them, but I admit that
it was my first occasion to admire them. I am
a trivial Jap, only acquainted with cherry
blossoms and lanterns. How I wished to knot
the bells round my waist, and whisk down the
path by the violets!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lover’s lane!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It should be the title for that path, I thought,
if I were Mr. Poet.</p>

<p class='c009'>I finished my toilet. I leaped out upon the
grasses smiling up to the sunlight.</p>

<p class='c009'>I congratulated myself on my new life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I found my uncle sitting by the camp-fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ohayo!” I said, filling the seat on another
side.</p>

<p class='c009'>I remember one Japanese essay, “The
Poetry of a Tea Kettle.” Indeed! The kettle
was a singer. Its melody was far-reaching.
It was like a harp of pine leaves fingered by the
zephyr.</p>

<p class='c009'>I faced up, and saw my poet moving down
from the lily pond. Two frogs in his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frogs?” I cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They will complete our table. How did
you sleep, my lady?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Splendid!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you love the country?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I begin to taste a greater joy in Nature.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m happy to hear it, my dear. My life is
like the life of a bird. I awake when the sun
rises. I lay me in the bed at the bird’s dipping
into its nest. God made the night for keeping
quiet. That is better than prayer itself.
I light neither lamp nor candle. I presume
that every young lady has certain secret work
at night. Let me offer you a few candles!”</p>

<p class='c009'>We ate breakfast from the table by the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frogs supplied a special dish.</p>

<p class='c009'>I couldn’t touch it, thinking of the songs of
frogs that I had heard all the night long.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a song! It was the muddy-booted
song of the countryside. No valuable quality
in it, of course. But I should say that they
tried the best they could.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Messrs. Frog!</p>

<p class='c009'>I fancied the leg in my dish was that of one
who volunteered to sing my lullaby.</p>

<p class='c009'>I almost cried in grief.</p>

<p class='c009'>The poet was ready to wash the dishes. I
was quick to snatch his job. My uncle wiped
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stupid uncle!</p>

<p class='c009'>He broke two dishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>I collected the bones of the frogs, and buried
them. On the stone above them I wrote
with a pencil:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tomb of Unknown Singers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>What time was it when we were done with
our breakfast?</p>

<p class='c009'>I couldn’t tell.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first thing I did yesterday was to stop
the tick-tack of my watch, and hide it in the
lowest drawer.</p>

<p class='c009'>The watch is a nuisance since I am thrown
in <span class='sc'>The Garden of Eternity</span>.</p>
<p class='c014'>3rd—I searched for a pen and ink in my
Willow Cottage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing like those.</p>

<p class='c009'>Foxy Poet!</p>

<p class='c009'>He hid them from view, I fancied, in the
opinion that playing with them for a girl is
more jeopardous than swallowing needles.</p>

<p class='c009'>I say that letter-writing—particularly a decent
love letter, if there is one—isn’t half so
grave a crime as rhyming.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was spraying some water on a rose by the
gate, when I caught sight of a white quill by
my shoes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This will serve me perfectly,” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had not one thing with any tooth except
my comb. (Comb? Luckily I have not lost
it Ara, ma, my hairpins! Five of them vanished
from my head while I was springing
amid the rocks. By and by the stems of acacia
leaves shall be used in their places. Don’t
you know this is quite a remote spot from civilisation?)
A kitchen knife shaped my quill
as a pen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now only ink!</p>

<p class='c009'>I begged Uncle to run down three miles to
fetch one bottle.</p>
<p class='c014'>4th—We went to “breathe the song of the
forest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The forest laces the poet’s canyon.</p>

<p class='c009'>(By the way, poet’s ground spreads over
one hundred and fifty acres. Does he pay
taxes?)</p>

<p class='c009'>We climbed the “Road to the Milky Way.”
I beseech your forgiveness, it was merely the
name I wished for the path to the poet’s hilltop.
I felt as if I were hurrying to the “Sermon
on the Mount.” You would hardly believe
Morning Glory if she said that sublimity
vibrated in her soul, because she was just a
little Oriental. How grand! We faced
toward the Gate of the Pacific Ocean. We
were still. Why? Because we were thinking
the same thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>We traversed the poet’s graveyard.</p>

<p class='c009'>How romantic to put up a tombstone while
living!</p>

<p class='c009'>How romantic to lie in the ecstasy of a marvellous
view! We could be nearer the stars
here.</p>

<p class='c009'>We stepped down to the canyon.</p>

<p class='c009'>The poet said solemnly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady and gentleman, this is a holy place
where you can pray heartily.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle started to drone Bryant’s hymn:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The groves were God’s first temples.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Did you ever read Thanatopsis, my dear?”
Mr. Heine asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a noble piece. So many thousand
Asiatics converted every year to the English
alphabet. Wonderful!” he soliloquised.</p>

<p class='c009'>We seated ourselves by a brook.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such a lesson in Nature! We endeavour
to transcribe, but fail,” he sighed, looking
on the trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he turned to me questioning:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you hear the silent song of the forest?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silence! Silence!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>We walked among the trees. We came
back to the same hilltop, when the large red
ball of the sun sank heavily from the Gate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bye-bye!” I shook my handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c009'>The playful breeze carried it away. It
glimmered like a silvery inspiration. Who
knows how far it sailed?</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought a huge statue of the Muse bidding
sayonara to the dying sun would be the
fitting ornamentation for these Heights.
Countless numbers of people would look upon
it from the valley. It would be a salvation, if
they could bind themselves with Poesy by its
noble figure. There was no question it would
be more effective than a thousand pages of
poem.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no coin to build it,” the poet said,
in dear openness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me present it by and by!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When?</p>

<p class='c009'>“When? It must be after I get married to
a rich philanthropist.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>We rolled down the hill in the purple fragrance
of evening. The evening was sweet
like a legend.</p>
<p class='c014'>5th—I wrote a letter to the artist:</p>

<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>My sweet Oscar:</span></p>
<p class='c025'>“You will love no more your Morning
Glory, I am certain, when you are informed
how she looks nowadays.</p>

<p class='c020'>“She inclines against a willow trunk by her
cottage. Were you ever acquainted with the
great repose of a poetess? Her eyes flash in
divine sarcasm. She will shoot them down to
the mortal domain (she lives on the mountain),
while she murmurs in tragical accents: ‘I pity
you, ant-mortals!’</p>

<p class='c020'>“Isn’t she shocking?</p>

<p class='c020'>“Oscar, I have withdrawn to the Heights,
and am prying into the Incomprehensible of
Nature with Mr. Heine.</p>

<p class='c020'>“He is unique.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I take it upon me to say that he is a great
poet. Because, in the first place, he never
asked me yet, ‘Do poems pay in Japan?’</p>

<p class='c020'>“It’s such a trying work for an old man like
him to pose as a poet all the time.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Poet is a sensitive creation. He fancies, I
think, the whole world is staring at him. Poor
Poet! He keeps up, and tries to be picturesque
as he can.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I am grieved to state, however, that his
picturesqueness frequently drops into silliness.</p>

<p class='c020'>“The absurd thing is that even my uncle
takes a part in his farce.</p>

<p class='c020'>“We had no meat to bite yesterday.</p>

<p class='c020'>“The poet had no shot left for his gun.</p>

<p class='c020'>“What did he plan, do you imagine?</p>

<p class='c020'>“He went up the hill, shouldering his pick.
My uncle retainered him with a spade.</p>

<p class='c020'>“‘We will soon bring back a squirrel which
we will dig out, Miss Morning Glory,’ the poet
said.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Could you ever suppose, Oscar, that any animal
except an invalid (an animal who has four
feet at that, instead of two like my venerable
gentlemen) could permit itself to be so slow like
them?</p>

<p class='c020'>“I laughed till my side ached.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Funny old men!</p>

<p class='c020'>“Every sort of sweat fell from their brows
when they dragged their fatigued feet home
not accompanied by even one inch of any animal
tail.</p>

<p class='c020'>“‘I have never heard yet, Mr. Poet, of a
squirrel turned to turnip,’ I gibed.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I dread old age, because it makes woman
inquisitive, and man silly. Inquisitiveness is
tasteless like wax, while silliness is helpless,
like a fish on the sand.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I fear you are silly already, when you say
that you sat up late looking at my picture.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Sat up late?</p>

<p class='c020'>“What will you do if your mamma thinks
you can’t sleep from hard drink when you
yawn continually at the table?</p>

<p class='c020'>“Please, don’t do it again!</p>

<p class='c020'>“Step to your bed at half-past six as I
do!</p>

<p class='c020'>“Are you sure that my picture approved
your act?</p>

<p class='c020'>“I guess it shrugged its shoulders from contempt,
the delicious moment of blushing being
passed.</p>

<p class='c020'>“If my picture is so precious, I advise you to
alter it to ashes. You will take two spoonfuls
of the ashes every morning. I am sure, then,
your soul will be saved.</p>

<p class='c020'>“O my darling, I love you!</p>
<p class='c021'>“I am your</p>
<p class='c023'>“<span class='sc'>Little Jap Girl</span></p>

<p class='c020'>“P.S.—This letter was written by my duck-quill.
My new invention, you know.</p>

<p class='c020'>“My handwriting is clumsy enough, I suppose,
to sell as high as any ancient author’s
autograph.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Sayonara!”</p>
<p class='c014'>6th—O poppy, beloved harbinger of California
spring!</p>

<p class='c009'>I “hung on the honourable eyes” of a
poppy by my door. Its quaking cup burnt
in love (for a meadow-lark perhaps).</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me feed you, my new friend!” I said,
and brought out a cupful of water.</p>

<p class='c009'>I moistened it.</p>

<p class='c009'>A golden flake of the sun-ray came down to
it. It smiled, daintily thanking me for my
humble treat.</p>

<p class='c009'>I stared at it, slowly fabricating a fable of
its love affair, when the breeze sent me a
dreamy song.</p>

<p class='c009'>The song was old-fashioned, like the afternoon
snore of a water-wheel.</p>

<p class='c009'>I plunged into the song, not knowing who
was the singer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ara, ara, Grandmamma’s song!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>She is the aged mother of our poet. She
is within the rim of ninety. I suspected her
of having discovered the “Elixir for Preserving
Eternal Girlhood.” You cannot help
esteeming her a philosopher when you are
told that she has visited San Francisco only
twice in ten years. I have no bit of doubt
that she would die if you were to rob her of
the sight of her flower garden and one stout
scrap-book about her son’s poems. They work
a miracle. What a mystery is human life!</p>

<p class='c009'>I say that I’m touched by superstition.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have read of a villainous fox who masquerades
in the shape of an old woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>My wretched fantasy about Mrs. Heine
passed, when I heard that no fox resided in
the hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>She is such a dear grandma.</p>

<p class='c009'>She has no hostile grimace against age.
She welcomes it. Her wrinkles are all her
beauty. Natural ripening in age is but
another form of girlhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>She is happy as a sparrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>(Sparrow never forgets, it is said in Nippon,
to dance in its hundredth year.)</p>

<p class='c009'>She hoes round her garden. Her vanity is
to make her table rich with her own potatoes
and roses.</p>

<p class='c009'>She lives alone by herself in a cottage some
hundred steps from mine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Did you ever taste her cooking?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good morning, Mrs. Heine!” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come in!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She showed herself, extending her large
hands. They were damp. I thought she was
employing herself in washing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is there any sweeter occupation than service
to an old lady?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me help you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I carried out a bucket to a spring in the
backyard.</p>

<p class='c009'>I brimmed it with the waters. It was so
weighty. A naughty stone bounced under
my heel. I was thrown down like a toy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas!</p>

<p class='c009'>My bucket was upset over my skirt.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had made myself a specimen of misery.
“O grandma, it’s raining awfully outside!”
I cried.</p>
<p class='c014'>7th—To-day I was the <i>chef</i>, while my uncle
was second cook.</p>

<p class='c009'>I placed a heroic iron pot over the camp-fire
I dropped a lump of beef in, and afterward
the mass of potatoes, carrots, and onions.
Mr. Poet’s directions were that they should
boil for two hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Heine intruded, saying that he would
like to season them himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Longfellow, Lowell—they all loved high
seasoning as I,” he said, snatching a pepper-box
from my hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>He kept tapping the bottom of the box,
when the cover fell into the pot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oya!</p>

<p class='c009'>The red pepper garmented the whole thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go, Mr. Poet! Why don’t you mind
your own business? You are butler to-day.”
I spoke in rough sweetness, and drove him
away.</p>

<p class='c009'>He began to place a linen cloth on the
table, while I dipped up all the pepper. He
picked up one dozen pebbles to weight the
tablecloth. The first thing he put on the
table was his claret bottle. How could he
lose it from sight! When he said that everything
was in place, he had forgotten the knives
and forks. Dear old poet!</p>

<p class='c009'>We sat at the table under the wild rose
bushes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Heine read aloud the following menu:</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Typical Tokio Smile of Miss Morning Glory.</span>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>My grandmamma was our guest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother, you talk too much always. Remember,
this is a sacred service. Silence helps
your digestion. Eat slowly, think something
higher, and be content!” Poet said.</p>

<p class='c009'>We smelled the “Perfume of Omar’s Rose,”
and wet our lips with the “Water of Jordan
River.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The broth was served.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everybody choked with its pungent fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Mrs. Heine!</p>

<p class='c009'>She was showering her tear-beans.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is perfectly seasoned. Send up your
bowl again, ladies and gentlemen!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Poet’s performance was beautifully
buffoonish.</p>

<p class='c009'>We finished our meat and vegetables.</p>

<p class='c009'>I smiled lightly, and said: “Are you ready
for the Tokio smile?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just ten minutes yet, my dear!” The
poet smoothed such a lengthy gray beard.</p>

<p class='c009'>I winked to Grandma. We looked upon
him slyly.</p>
<p class='c014'>8th—The poet was hoeing in his vegetable
garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>His attire was theatrical.</p>

<p class='c009'>His red crape sash laxly surrounding his
trousers lacked, I am sorry to say, a large
Japanese tobacco bag. The cap with gay
ribbons was like one of Li Hung Chang’s.
His back carried a bearskin, inside of which
some slovenly yellow silk flapped down.</p>

<p class='c009'>How tall he was!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, don’t dig over there, Mr. Heine,
because I buried my poem there,” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What poem, my lady?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The poem to be read at the unveiling of
my statue of the Muse on your mountain top,
which may occur possibly within five years.
The opening lines sound thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Victor of Life and Song,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>O Muse of golden grace!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“That’s great! Why did you bury it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you bury your poems? The best
poems are those not published. The very
best are those not written. Dante Gabriel
Rosetti buried his ‘House of Life,’ because
they were not for a gaping millionaire’s wife,
but only for his own little wife. But his greatness
was ruined when he dug them up and
sold them. Poor poet! What all the poets
ought to do, I think, is to bury their poems in
a potato garden. What a shame even the
poets have to eat once in a while! They
should wait till the potatoes grow, and then
sell them in a vegetable stand, calling ‘Poetical
Potatoes!’ Do you sell your poems, Mr.
Heine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aren’t you making your living with your
fruits?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never sell them, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I give them to needy persons. But I was
obliged, last year, to hang up a sign, ‘No
Fruit Lover is Wanted.’ I told an Oakland
minister to come up and eat <i>some</i> plums. He
brought his wife and children, even his grand-mother.
They shouldered away every bit of
fruit from half a dozen trees. Next day so
many people trampled in with an introduction
from the minister.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such a minister! I see no use to have
the sign, ‘Fruit Grower,’ if you don’t sell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my dear lady, God will be merciful
to let me use it in place of ‘Poem Manufacturer!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle announced that tea was boiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>We left the garden.</p>
<p class='c014'>9th—The fogs held possession of our world,
like the darkness of night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where did they invade from?</p>

<p class='c009'>Pacific Ocean?</p>

<p class='c009'>Our hillside cottages looked like a tottering
ship having no hope for any haven.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tremendous sight!</p>

<p class='c009'>I planted me on the hilltop. My mind
merged in Japanese mythology. I felt as if I
were the first goddess, Izanagi, standing on the
“Floating Bridge of Heaven,” before the
creation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The divine ghastliness bit my little soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>I couldn’t stand against it. I crept down
like a mouse.</p>

<p class='c009'>The poet said he was preparing a lecture.
Its title was “Not in Books.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He in his bed—there he passes every forenoon—was
reciting his song.</p>

<p class='c009'>The words leapt like a leaping sword:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sail on! Sail! Sail on! And on!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I threw a bunch of roses over to his bed as
an admirer does to a star.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I clapped my hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pan, pan! Pan, pan!”</p>
<p class='c014'>10th—I went up the hill to gather mushrooms
and watercresses.</p>

<p class='c009'>I filled a huge basket with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>I carried it down on my shoulder in
Chinese laundry style. I paused every twenty
steps.</p>

<p class='c009'>I slipped within the gate of Mrs. Heine’s
back garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mush—rooms! Water—cresses!” I
called boisterously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear girl!” Grandma smiled out from
her door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep your hands off, please! They are
things for sale. To-day they are uncommonly
cheap. Will you buy them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much do you charge?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two thousand words of the story about
your illustrious son’s life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a funny vendor!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me something about him! I’m ready
to leave you the whole business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall I narrate to you how he started to
write?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How interesting!” I ejaculated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me see your things first!” she said,
tugging the basket nearer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear child, they aren’t watercresses,
but baby weeds. I don’t consider they are
legitimate mushrooms, either.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned upon me with compassionate
objection.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oya, oya, you don’t say so!”  I exclaimed.
“Then, no story, Grandma?” I looked up
meekly.</p>
<p class='c014'>11th—We had sipped our supper tea some
time ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>A band from the bay sent up irregularly the
melody of the love and prowess of dear
mariners.</p>

<p class='c009'>The white moon rose.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sat alone on my front step, and watched
tenderly by the poppy.</p>

<p class='c009'>My darling Miss Poppy shook herself
prettily, as if she uttered a sweet word out of
her heart. I imagined every sort of speech
that may come from such a tiny bit of flower.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sodah, she said that she loved me!” I
murmured.</p>

<p class='c009'>I made a little letter.</p>

<p class='c026'>“<span class='sc'>Miss Poppy</span>:</p>
<p class='c025'>“I love you too.</p>
<p class='c027'>“Yours,</p>
<p class='c028'>“<span class='sc'>Morning Glory</span>.”</p>

<p class='c003'>I rolled it to a ball. I dropt it in her cup.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moon turned gold. The evening odour
filled the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>Look!</p>

<p class='c009'>She was folding her cup, pressing my missive
to her breast. There was no question that she
understood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dearest friend!</p>

<p class='c009'>Was it silly that I cried?</p>
<p class='c014'>12th—The poet left the Heights to exchange
his MS. for a gallon of whiskey.</p>

<p class='c009'>He carried a demijohn, which was as apt to
him as a baby to a woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>I volunteered to clean his holy grotto.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little cottage brought me a thought of
one Jap sage who lived by choice in a ten-foot
square mountain hut. The venerable Mr.
Chomei Kamo wrote his immortal “Ten-Foot
Square Record.” A bureau, a bed, and one
easy chair—everything in the poet’s abode
inspires repose—occupy every bit of space in
Mr. Heine’s cottage. The wooden roof is
sound enough against a storm. A fountain is
close by his door. Whenever you desire, you
may turn its screw and hear the soft melody
of rain.</p>

<p class='c009'>That’s plenty. What else do you covet?</p>

<p class='c009'>The closetlessness of his cottage is a symbol
of his secretlessness. How enviable is an
open-hearted gentleman! Woman can never
tarry a day in a house without a closet.</p>

<p class='c009'>He never closes his door through the year.</p>

<p class='c009'>A piece of wire is added to his entrance
at night. He would say that that will keep
out the tread of a dog and a newspaper reporter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not even one book.</p>

<p class='c009'>He would read the history written on the
brow of a star, he will say if I ask him why.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every side was patched by pictures and a
medley of paper clippings. Is there anything
sweeter to muse upon than personal knick-nacks?</p>

<p class='c009'>O such a dust!</p>

<p class='c009'>I swept it.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I thought philosophically afterward, why
should people be so fussy with the dust, when
things are but another form of dust. What a
far-away smell the dust had! What an
ancient colour!</p>

<p class='c009'>I observed on the wall an odd coat and boots
that dear old Santa Claus might have lost.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Klondyke costume!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I undressed myself, and tried them on.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I was ready to put on a fur cap, Mrs.
Heine wandered down, calling me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Morning Glory! Morning Glory!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I trembled in deadly fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>I hid me promptly by the bureau, under the
bed. I shut my eyes, praying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Namu Daijingu, don’t let her find me!”</p>
<p class='c014'>13th—Last midnight (O voicelessness of the
hillside yonaka!) I woke up. The moon
peeped into my sitting-room. She laid a
square looking-glass on the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>I abandoned my bed, and sat by the glass.</p>

<p class='c009'>I spread on it the letter from my sweetheart.</p>

<p class='c009'>I read it over and over, till I couldn’t read
any more, the moon being kidnapped by the
cloud-highwayman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Oscar!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I cried in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>I could not slumber all the night, on account
of my thought of him.</p>

<p class='c009'>A letter was written to him to-day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nature and love! I am now living with
them.</p>
<p class='c014'>14th—I elaborated a nosegay.</p>

<p class='c009'>The poet and uncle dignified themselves in
frock-coats.</p>

<p class='c009'>The coming of the coffin was slow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Poet had proffered his own graveyard
to let an unknown poet lodge there. “Is it
because you want some one to greet you when
you die?” I said in laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>I seated myself by a creek.</p>

<p class='c009'>I entered involuntarily into the riddle of Life
and Death.</p>

<p class='c009'>The water under my feet rolled down, positively
not knowing why nor whence. The
wind passed, “willy-nilly blowing.” I wondered
whither it went. Mr. Omar is unquestionably
a true poet. The petals of a rose
before me fell.</p>

<p class='c009'>I murmured:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Each Morn a thousand Roses brings, you say;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I was crying in sadness when the coffin
arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Heine and my uncle lifted it by either
edge. The neighbouring farmers and two
sardonically cool gentlemen from the undertaker’s
aided them. The jaw-fallen papa of
the dead carried all the posies.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Miss Morning Glory (who is the belle
of Tokio) shouldered a bench for the purpose
of sustaining the coffin when they were tired.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hill is precipitous.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gentlemen stopped numberless times,
before they stationed themselves on the top.</p>

<p class='c009'>The grave was hollowed behind Mr. Poet’s
monument. They sank the coffin.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a tremor of silence sharpened the air!
I was shaking.</p>

<p class='c009'>The poor papa read a chapter from the
Bible. He described his loving son’s life, in
doleful honourableness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are a thousand flowers in Spring,”—the
poet spoke—“whose repute is not extensively
spoken, like that of the rose or violet.
Some of them are not given even a name.
They spend their smile and odour into the
breeze, and die without any repining. They
are content, because they are true to God.
So a poet’s life should be. What is celebrity?
Keats was told of his beautiful graveyard, and
he said: ‘I have already seemed to feel the
flowers growing over me.’ If this poet, whom
we now bury, had been told of this hill, he
might have said: ‘I see already the butterflies
beaming over my head.’ Spring is coming.
The poppies and buttercups shall dress the
hill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A church-bell chimed from the valley.</p>

<p class='c009'>We left the buried to his solitude.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>My uncle and I sat under an acacia tree,
silent for some time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look, Morning Glory!” he said, exhibiting
a silver piece.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there any story about that dollar?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The father of the dead paid me for carrying
the coffin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle, did you accept it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such a funny uncle!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have spoiled all your nobility for only
one dollar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I upturned my face, afterward, appealing in
gleeful tone:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Uncle, you ought to give me half of it.
Fifty cents! I carried the bench, you know.”</p>
<p class='c014'>15th—I arose at the first whistling of a
meadow-lark.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hearken to its hailing morning voice!</p>

<p class='c009'>O simple bird!</p>

<p class='c009'>Its so various moods are expressed only in
its eternally changeless syllables. What a
magical song!</p>

<p class='c009'>How bungling seemed our human vocabularies!</p>

<p class='c009'>I trod the garden in bare feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Naked feet, sir!</p>

<p class='c009'>The delicious chilliness of the ground animated
me rapturously. Do you believe me if
I confess that I knelt and kissed it? I said
that I would not mind burying my nude body
for a few hours. Mother earth is so sweet.</p>

<p class='c009'>I ran up the hill, humming an Oriental ditty.</p>

<p class='c009'>The air was relishable, like an ice-cream on
a summer midnight.</p>

<p class='c009'>The beautiful sun was rising.</p>

<p class='c009'>I clapped my palms thrice, reverently bowing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Am I a sun-worshipper?</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes!</p>

<p class='c009'>I cleansed my feet in the water of the creek
when I returned from the hill. I sat me on a
rock, extending my bare feet in the sunlight.
I thought that towel-wiping was too much of
a modernism.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle! O Uncle!” I called.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, Miss Morning Glory?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The poet jutted out from a bamboo bush
by the wooden bridge over the creek.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such charming feet!” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I instantly lowered my skirt, blushing.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was carrying a spade and hoe. He said
that he had been planting flowers about the
grave of our friend, ever since four o’clock.
“To make it beautiful is high poetry,” he
philosophised.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you wish with Uncle, my child?”
he continued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want my shoes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me have the honour of fetching them
for you!” he said in amiably dignified docility.</p>
<p class='c014'>16th—The poet gave me five feet square,
behind the Willow Cottage, for my potato
garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sticked a stick at each corner. I encircled
it with my crape sash.</p>

<p class='c009'>The note hanging on it read, “Graveyard
of Morning Glory’s Poem.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I hired uncle for ten cents, to clear off every
weed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I raked.</p>

<p class='c009'>I set the seeds.</p>

<p class='c009'>I got a suspicious coat and pants from a
nook in the unrespectable barn. It was fortunate
that the horse—who may also be a
poet, he is so philosophically thin,—didn’t
shout, “Hoa, clothes-thief!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I put them on the limbs of an acacia tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>I planted it on my graveyard to scare away
wild intruders.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is holy ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wondered when the potatoes would grow.</p>
<p class='c014'>17th—Squirrel!</p>

<p class='c009'>What admirable eyes!</p>

<p class='c009'>He projected his head from a hole by my
window. He withdrew it a bit, and bent it to
one side, as if he were solving a question or
two.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then his eyes stabbed my face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m no questionable character, Mr.
Squirrel,” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>He hid himself altogether.</p>

<p class='c009'>I amassed some crusts of bread by his hole,
and watched humbly for his honourable presence.</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not peep out at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bread was not a worthy invitation. I
varied it with a fragment of ham.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Squirrel wasn’t void-stomached.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought he needed something to read. I
tore a poem from the wall. I left it by his respectable
cavern.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lo!</p>

<p class='c009'>His head sprouted out to pull it in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aha, even the squirrel is a poetry devotee,
in this hill!” I said in humourous mood.</p>
<p class='c014'>18th—</p>

<p class='c029'>“<span class='sc'>Most Beloved</span>:</p>
<p class='c030'>“Mamma was flogged with a bamboo
rod some hundred times when she was a girl,
her exchanging of a word with a boy over the
fence being deemed an obscenity. My papa
spent his lonely days in a room with Confucious
till one night a middleman left him with
my mamma as with a dolly. I do believe they
never wrote any love letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What would they say, I wonder, if they
knew that their daughter had taken to Love-Letter
Writing as a profession in Amerikey?</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shouldn’t censure my penury in writing,
knowing that I am a musume from such a
source.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oscar, are your windows clean?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every window of my Willow Cottage was
washed yesterday. Is there anything more
happy to see (your beautiful eyes excepted)
than a shiny window? I pressed my cheek to
the window mirthfully, when Mr. Poet tried
to pinch it from the outside. My dearest, if
he had been my very Mr. Ellis!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I made a discovery while I was trimming
about the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you guess what it was?</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Love-Letter Writer!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Gift from Heaven!’ I said, trusting it
would help me in my composition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I lit a candle last night. I hid it behind the
cover of such a huge bible which I had borrowed
for the purpose. I was heedful of two old
men who might disturb me, mistaking the
light for a sign that something had happened.
Poor Mrs. Heine almost cried, she was so
pleased to think that I loved the Bible. Do
I love it? Oho, ho, ho——</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bakabakashi, how sad!</p>

<p class='c009'>“The whole bunch of letters wasn’t fit for my
taste at all, at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry that I used up two candles that
were all we had in this hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So, my darling, my letter has to be woven
from my truest heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good morning, my sweet lord! How are
you? Have you breakfasted? Did you eat
a beefsteak? I dislike a hearty morning eater.
My ideal man shouldn’t be given more than a
cup of coffee and one trembling leaf of bacon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Poet kills a frog every morning. He
says that his fancy springs like a pond singer
when he tastes it. I should say that his idea
bounds too far in his case.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you eat frog?</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beseech you not to incline toward it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What should I do if your thought ran off
from me?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Failure of my life! Love is the whole business
of woman, you know.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you any shirt to mend?</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been fixing the poet’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray, express it to me!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Should you ask such a pleasure of any other

It is needless to say that we loved. One
spring day we floated down along the canyon
from a mountain a thousand miles afar. Our
path was suddenly barred by a dense bush. We
couldn’t attain to the Garden of Life without
adventuring in it. So, then, you stole in from
one place, I from another. Alas! We got
parted forever.</p>

am awfully agitated by it.</p>

nest under the roof, by my door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dear jovial toiler!</p>

<p class='c009'>I must help him in some way.</p>

<p class='c009'>I unravelled one of my stockings, hoping it
might be serviceable in bettering his home.</p>

<p class='c009'>I stood me on a chair, raising up my arms
with my gift.</p>

<p class='c009'>The poor sparrow was scared. He cast a
gray “honourableness” on my hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>O naughty “chui chui!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He winged away, twittering, “chui, chui,

great fancy for me. He honoured me three
times already this morning. He bore a somewhat
scholarly air. A retired professor, I
reckon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is he regular with his diary?</p>

<p class='c009'>Possibly he is idle with a pen, like any other
professor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Friend, stop a minute! Take a glass
with me before you go!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The poet rolled out with a claret bottle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Did you ever see a Chinee in love? Did
you ever see one smile?</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Charley smiled a serene smile of the
Flower Kingdom pattern.</p>

<p class='c009'>“God bless the Empress Dowager!” Mr.
Poet said. Both raised their wine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The load is too heavy for you. You are
killing yourself. I can’t bear to see it. My
friend, obey me! Let me help you! Don’t
leave till I come back!”</p>

buggy and horse. He cracked his whip—he
never whips the horse, but he carries it for
fashion’s sake, as he remarks—when Mr.
Charley protested, “Me oll-righ, you savvy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Chinaman was dumbfounded, for the
poet was unknown to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Heine pushed him in.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he leaped up, he noticed his horse in
tender tone:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on, baby!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a goody-goody! His act never
parts from poetry, however,” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was simply dying for an opportunity to
explode my good heart, when I invited one
tramp to my Willow Cottage.</p>

<p class='c009'>I fed him with one dozen eggs.</p>

<p class='c009'>I emptied out all my change for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you feel cold, lying outdoors?” I
said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Miss!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you need an overcoat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Miss!”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Mr. Tramp left me with an overcoat
in his hand, looking like a proud Mayor
of Tokio, my uncle was coming from Mrs.
Heine’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle, you do want to be good to a poor
man, don’t you? You have made yourself a
great philanthropist with your overcoat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What have you done?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I presented it to a tramp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Morning Glory!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, Uncle! I will buy a swell
coat in New York. You have some more,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It cost me forty yens at ’Hama. You
really are a foolish girl, Asagao!”</p>

<p class='c009'>(Asagao is my humble name in Japanese.)</p>

fun for my part, of course.</p>

<p class='c009'>She mailed me an o mikuji from the holy
box of the Akiwa god.</p>

The divine will read as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Faith in the Well-God will result fortunately.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mamma bade me make my prayer long (not
mixing it with any laughter whatever).</p>

<p class='c009'>I wondered whether there was any well
around here.</p>

<p class='c009'>I explored. I came across one (such a
doubtful well) by an apple tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>I hastened to my cottage to cut a paper
flag.</p>

<p class='c009'>The poet gave me one cup of claret for the
Well-God.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sat by the well.</p>

<p class='c009'>What did I pray?</p>

<p class='c009'>I pried into the well for the fin of a fish.
Well without a funa fish isn’t holy to a Jap
mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have encountered somewhere one picture,
“Stolen Kiss,” symbolising sweetness.</p>

<p class='c009'>I dare say the sweetest thing in the world
is to steal into a gentleman’s room and over-turn
his things.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gentleman smell is provocative.</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle?</p>

<p class='c009'>I can only say that he is more desirable
than an old woman. Old woman is sad as a
dry persimmon.</p>

<p class='c009'>I stole into his room.</p>

<p class='c009'>God will overlook my petty crime—how
lovely to be scratched by guilt!—in consideration
of the fact that a Jap girl never profanes.</p>

<p class='c009'>I turned his pillow. Pillow is a fascination
for me ever since I have read of a poet who
hid his diary under it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Look at the book, “A Random Note!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was working to beat me with his journal,
I derided.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sat on his bed, opening it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How original!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle, you are a cynic, aren’t you?</p>

<p class='c009'>Let me pick a few pieces from his pen!</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c009'>“Unfortunately! Japanese are accustomed
from babyhood to depend on another’s back.
The hereditary fashion of nursing the baby on
the back has thoroughly taught them dependence.
Independence is only a coat of arms
to distinguish man from the beasts—that is
all. I urge that Emerson’s essays be adopted
in the Nippon schools. His ‘Self-reliance’
should be the first of all.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most unhappily! I have observed the
Japanese fad in America for years, and it has
not yet reached its culmination. Each month
the books on Japan are placed before the public.
It is verily sad even to cut their edges.
(The practical Americans prove themselves
unpractical in leaving the leaves of books
uncut.) I say that our Japan is entitled
to regard for worthier things than geisha girls
or a fashion in bowing. We should decline
your love, Americans, if it is rooted merely in
your fancy for our paper lanterns. I have
frequently come to conclude that Americans
are eminently the freakish nation. I feel not
only occasionally that they lack the reasoning
power. I do not assume the phenomena of
the yellow journals as my proof.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A year or two ago, one Japanese theatrical
troup roamed. They are not catalogued
at home as actors. They chose to skip on the
stage, simply because a bit more money is in
it than in the calling of ‘lantern-carrying for
politicians.’ Any wild animal can skip. I am
now confronted with the question whether
American generosity is not without sense.
They piled up their money for them. Even
the first-class critics struggled to find out something
from such poor art. I am bound to be
thankful, however, for the Americans saved
these poor players from bankruptcy in Japan.
It reminds me of a story. Our Nippon government
many years ago appointed a certain
loafing sailor as an English instructor, giving
him a monthly pay of three hundred dollars.
Sailor with an anchor-tatoo on his hand!
Three hundred dollars are no small coin in
Japan. Our sailor professor said, I am told,
that he had not heard of any Milton. Ignorance
can easily be a philanthropist, if it can be
anything.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Japanese love Nature? They do. But
how sad to glance at Japanese garden! It
is painful to notice the dwarf trees. Japs never
permit one thing to grow naturally. Country
of deformity! America, most natural, most
manly nation!”</p>
<p class='c014'>24th—My uncle didn’t come back yesterday. Mr. Poet condescended to the town.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>I spent the entire forenoon with Grandma,
peeling potatoes, strewing sweet pea seeds on
the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>I ascended the hill with the root of a white
rose—believing in the Nippon idea that blossoms
for the dead should be white—and set it
by the grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I stole into the canyon.</p>

<p class='c009'>I amassed the dead leaves of redwood by
the brook for a camp-fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>The smoke rose like a soul unto heaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>I watched its beautiful confusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I left, a snake obstructed my path,
flashing its needle of a tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>Snake, one of my greatest foes! (The
others being cheese and mathematics.)</p>

<p class='c009'>I turned pale.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I bravely faced it, hoping that it would
speak a word or two, as one did to Eve. I
placed my eyes on it, though in fear. Perhaps
it wasn’t as intelligent as the one in the garden
of Eden. Maybe it thought it nothing but a
waste of time to address a Jap poorly stored
in English. It crept away.</p>

<p class='c009'>I ran down the hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>A storm of laughter struck me from within
when I came to my Willow Cottage. I examined
it from the window. Half a dozen
young ladies were biting pie. (Pie! Rustic
pastry I ever so hate!)</p>

<p class='c009'>“Picnic!” I murmured.</p>

<p class='c009'>My blood gushed up. I was on the verge
of denouncing their irruption. The cottage
belongs to any one, I said in my afterthought,
as it does to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I slipped away.</p>

<p class='c009'>I found myself in the plum orchard with a
hoe.</p>

<p class='c009'>I began to root the weeds. I waited silently
for their departure.</p>

<p class='c009'>The poet—the eternally sweet poet—hastened
to borrow a tent from a neighbour.</p>

<p class='c009'>He set it on the greenest spot of grass before
my cottage. I must excuse his conceit,
he entreated, in showing his skill by baking a
cake for me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Accept my hundred arigatos!”</p>

and Cake” on the fence by the tent.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cups (what a shame that their arms
were all off) were rinsed, when he showed me
an imperial poundcake, declaring it his own
manufacture.</p>

<p class='c009'>At three o’clock I was fully prepared for an
honorable guest.</p>

<p class='c009'>The coffee on the oil-stove was surging, when
two parties went by, not spending even one
look at my sign.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Times are awfully hard, I think. People
have not luxury enough to spare even a dime,”
I murmured sadly.</p>

<p class='c009'>I said that I would have no business, if I
didn’t make the next party my victim.</p>

<p class='c009'>I appeared before the tent, when a few
girls—who were born for laughing, but not
for thinking—came close by.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you rest and taste the cake that the
poet made, ladies?” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s nice,” they said, rolling into the
tent.</p>

<p class='c009'>I served them with coffee and cake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is this surely the poet’s cake? It looks
like baker’s cake,” one girl said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Poet assured me it was of his own
making,” I replied in cool reserve.</p>

<p class='c009'>After they left, I scrutinised the cake.
Oya! A little bakery mark was seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mighty liar!” I grumbled.</p>

<p class='c009'>Abrupt clouds clouded the sun. The winds
scolded bitterly. I decided there was no
business remaining.</p>

<p class='c009'>I called Mr. Heine and uncle into the Bishops’
Rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your cake was fine, Mr. Poet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know it, Miss Morning Glory. I’m a
pretty good cook, you see. I cooked once in
a Sierra camp for fifty miners. I was paid
twenty dollars a week. Alas! It was the
biggest money I ever earned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the way, Mr. Heine, the bakery sent a
bill for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I placed before him a slip that I had prepared
for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha! Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c009'>His open laughter was as from a simple
Faun.</p>

<p class='c009'>I noticed, afterward, a black mass heaped in
a ditch. The whole situation grew plain to
me. He couldn’t bake, but only burn, in the
oven, and had despatched his neighbour for the
cake.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dear Poet!</p>
<p class='c014'>26th—We pressed the poet to receive some money as just a sign of our gratitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Heine despised our thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>Honourable gentleman!</p>

<p class='c009'>I found a tin box. I put the money in—ask
me not how much!</p>

<p class='c009'>I dug a hole by the willow tree beside the
lily pond, and buried the money box. I tumbled
a stone over it to mark it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll write him about it from New York.
See, Uncle! Isn’t it unique?” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle wasn’t enthusiastic in approving my
idea. He couldn’t check me, however, as the
money was mine.</p>

<p class='c009'>He said he would order an elegant vase
from Tokio.</p>
<p class='c014'>27th—I intended to keep a sweet fashion of old Japan in presenting a poem at my sayonara.</p>

<p class='c009'>We will take leave to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>O gracious graceful poet abode!</p>

<p class='c009'>My farewell poem in seventeen syllable form

<p class='c014'>28th—Mrs. Heine kissed me.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dear old Grandma!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know what this is, Miss Morning
Glory?” the poet said, plucking a leaf from a
tree by his door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fig-leaf! Isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, my child! It is a fig-leaf. Do you
know the fig tree? It is the shyest tree in the
world. Classical tree, indeed! It has no
blossom, being so modest of display, but it
has the fruits. Remember, my young lady,
its teaching of ‘Modesty! Modesty!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sayonara, Mr. Poet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One minute, Uncle!” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I ran into the Willow Cottage to get a cupful
of water. I watered my friend Miss Poppy
with love.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bye-bye, little girl!</p>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>San Francisco</span>, March 1st</p>

<p class='c009'>Civilisation again!</p>

<p class='c009'>The first thing was to buy a cake of the
best soap.</p>

<p class='c009'>Because my hands had perfected their transformation
into worthless leather while I dwelt
on the hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>What kind of soap did I use, do you suppose?</p>

<p class='c009'>Laundry soap.</p>
<p class='c014'>2nd—Delightful Ada!</p>

<p class='c009'>We drove to the Cliff House, Ada to laugh
at the stupid song of the seals, I to say my
adieu.</p>

<p class='c009'>Good-bye, Pacific Ocean!</p>

<p class='c009'>We cried in hugging.</p>

<p class='c009'>We shall not see each other for some time,—maybe
never again!</p>

<p class='c009'>Ada!</p>

<p class='c009'>O Ada San!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Overland Train</span>, March 4th</p>

<p class='c009'>“Madame Butterfly” lay by me, appealing
to be read.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, iya, I’ll never open! I erred in buying
you,” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I dislike that “Madame.” It sounds indecent
ever since the “gentleman” Loti spoiled
it with his “Madame Chrysanthème.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The honourable author of “Madame Butterfly”
is Mr. Wrong. (Do you know that
Japanese have no boundary between L and
R?) Undoubtedly, he is qualified to be a
Wrong.</p>

<p class='c009'>Authorship is nothing at all, nowadays,
since authors are thick as Chinese laundries.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, still, it can be honourable, if it is honourable.</p>

<p class='c009'>Japanese fiction penned by the tojin!</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a completely sad affair. I wonder why
the author (God bless him) didn’t fit himself
for brooming the streets instead of scrawling.</p>

<p class='c009'>The characters in his book—I am grateful I
see no lady writer of Japanese novels yet—remind
me of the “devils of mixture” swarming
in Yokohama or Kobe, whose Jap mother was
a professional “hell.” It is lamentable to set
the verdict on them that they have inherited
the art of framing lies from their mamma.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do I vex you, gentleman, when I say that
your Japanese type could only be an unprincipled
half-caste?</p>

<p class='c009'>Your Nippon character eyed in blue, and
hairy-skinned always. Isn’t it absurd when it
puts a ’Merican shoe on one foot and a wooden
clog on the other?</p>

<p class='c009'>And if you insist on registering it as a Jap,
I shall merely laugh loudly.</p>

<p class='c009'>One heroine I have read of placed a light
summer haori over her heavily padded mid-winter
clothes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Your Oriental novel, let me be courageous
enough to say, is a farce at its best.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, just wait, my sweet Americans! A
genuine one will soon be offered to you by
Morning Glory.</p>

<p class='c009'>I stepped out to the platform, and threw
out “Madame Butterfly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor “Madame!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I trust in the mountain lions of high Nevada
to cherish her lovingly.</p>
<p class='c014'>5th—</p>
<p class='c019'>“Matsuba Sama, the following letter creeps
‘under your honourable table.’</p>

<p class='c020'>“How is yourself?</p>

<p class='c020'>“I imagine that the breeze fills your bower
with the odour of ume flowers. I am definite
in saying that the Japanese ume is of different
origin from the California plum tree, which
has no expression in divine fragrance as I am
told. I see your indolent face in the air,
awaiting poetical inspiration on your bamboo
piazza where the ume petals are beautifully
blotched.</p>

<p class='c020'>“There are several months yet till we shall
quarrel face-to-face over the superiority of
English or Oriental literature.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Miss Pine Leaf, I—or rather we—have
said farewell to Frisco.</p>

<p class='c020'>“It was sad that I never saw any battleship
(excepting one shamefaced gunboat) in the
bay of the Golden Gate. A bay without
battleship is like a door without a lock.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Can you fancy any Japanese city without
soldiers?</p>

<p class='c020'>“American soldier?</p>

<p class='c020'>“I am sorry to say that I have met no soldier
in my four months at the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I presume that the practical Meriken jins
can’t bear to see such a useless ornamentation.
Yes! Soldiers are degenerating, in my opinion,
to the rank of a fireplace on a hot summer
day. How stimulating, however, was the
sound of the fearless hoofs of a cavalier!
When the sabres of a regiment flashed in the
sunlight, I could never keep from fluttering
my paper handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I shall not excite myself in such a joy in
Amerikey.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I made the acquaintance of one colonel at
Mrs. Willis’. He is a jolly business man.
Just think of a colonel plus merchant! Is it
possible? He changes his white shirt every
morning, and shines his shoes twice a day. I
should say that he will carry a sheet and opera
hat, and leave his gun behind, whenever he is
summoned to a battle-field. Possibly he has
hidden his colonelship in his trunk.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I found afterward that every old gentleman
is a colonel or judge.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Everything in California is made for just a
woman.</p>

<p class='c020'>“California gentleman isn’t privileged to
raise one question against a lady. He is provided
with all sorts of exclamations to please
the woman. If he should ever miss one dinner
with his wife, he would be divorced in
court on the morrow.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Uncle says that the Eastern gents are not
so devoted to the lady.</p>

<p class='c020'>“If it be true!</p>

<p class='c020'>“Am I now entering the city of Man?</p>

<p class='c020'>“How sad!</p>

<p class='c020'>“Have you any experience of writing by the
car-window?</p>

<p class='c020'>“I feel a strange delight in scanning my romantically
tremulous handwriting. A certain
famous Jap penman takes wine before he begins,
for the sake of putting his mind in a fine
frenzy, as you know. The shaking of the car
produces in me the same effect. Isn’t this letter
great enough to be honoured on your tokonama?</p>

<p class='c020'>“Can you ever imagine how vast Amerikey
is?</p>

<p class='c020'>“Yesterday our car ran all day long, over the
mountains and prairies, seeing only a few huts.</p>

<p class='c020'>“O such a snowstorm in the evening!</p>

<p class='c020'>“The train rushed like a maddened dragon.
It was verily an astonishingly ghastly spectacle
as any human thought could ever picture.
I thrilled with a feeling of tragic ecstasy, which
is the highest emotion.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Can you recollect that you and I once
stood under the darkest rains without an
umbrella, and laughed hysterically?</p>

<p class='c020'>“I love shocking emotion.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Since I was touched by the continental air,
I measure my lungs dilating two inches bigger.
How sorry I shall be for you when I return!
You are so tiny! I expect myself to
be five inches higher within the next few
months.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Amerikey is the country where everything
grows, don’t you know?</p>

<p class='c020'>“Even the stars look a deal larger than in
Japan.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Looking back at the Rocky Mountains,</p>
<p class='c027'>“Yours,</p>
<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Asagao</span>”</p>
<p class='c014'>6th—The rocking of the train makes us
babies in the cradle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The car is a modern opium resort, where we
sleep and sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>I shouldn’t wonder if we all turned into
nodding Rip Van Winkles.</p>

<p class='c009'>To-day I had a sleeping contest with uncle.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was defeated.</p>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Chicago</span>, 7th</p>

<p class='c009'>Chicago water is a perfect horror.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gomenyo! That’s no way to begin, is it?</p>

<p class='c009'>I never waver in saying that California girls
borrow their fairness from their water.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is no question in my mind why the
Chicago women—certain hundreds I saw, if
you please—are barren in their complexion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Uncle, how many days have we to tarry
here?” I asked, within an hour after we had
set foot in this city.</p>

<p class='c009'>I grieve over my contact with such a city.
It is no place for a lady. (Is here any lady?)
It is just the place for a man.</p>

<p class='c009'>No show marked “Only for a Man” is respectable,
I dare say.</p>

<p class='c009'>Are Chicago men “gentlemen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>They are not sensitive about their hats in
the hotel elevator. The laundry work isn’t
superb, I judge, as not every one’s shirt is
snowy as a San Franciscan’s. I cannot
blame their black finger-nails, as they live in
smoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the Frisco smoke hindered my breath
at my opening moment in Amerikey. I should
have died, if it had been Chicago.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bodily cleanliness is the first chapter in the
whitening of the soul. How many mortals are
there here with a clear soul?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chicago is Mr. Nobody without the smoke,
like Japan without a fan. The prosperity of a
modern city is measured by the bulk of its
smoke, Morning Glory. But I don’t approve
of their using a cheap coal. Health has to be
guarded,” my uncle said.</p>

<p class='c009'>A driver carried us from the station as if we
were pigs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mind you, this is Chicago illustrious for its
hams.</p>

<p class='c009'>I barred my ears with my hands in the carriage.
The thunderous noise menaced me so.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do roses blossom well in the turbulent air?</p>

<p class='c009'>I have no doubt that Chicago has no poet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cook County fosters three thousand poets,
one paper says, my young woman,” Uncle said
in laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t say so!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As soon as I had established myself in the
hotel, I inscribed—with the longest apologetical
ojigi to Mr. Shelley—as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hell is a city much like Chicago,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A populous and a smoky city.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>8th—How sad I felt, not to be greeted by
even one star from my hotel window last
night!</p>

<p class='c009'>I was disgusted with the poor taste of the
coffee. Such a first-class hotel! Coffee
and maxim, I have said, should be of the
very best. Commonplace words with the
golden heading of Maxim would be as cheap
as a negress with white powder. I would
choose even a bread pudding rather than a
suspicious cup of coffee.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle failed to secure a box of cigarettes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The most delicate shape for smoking is the
slender stalk of a cigarette. The cigar ever
so much impresses me as barbarous. Chicagoans
might say it was the only manly
smoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>Truly!</p>

<p class='c009'>Chicago is the City of Man (whatever that
means).</p>

<p class='c009'>I’m glad that the young gentlemen with
genteel canes under their arms don’t open any
cigar-stand conference here. Such an abomination
in Frisco!</p>

<p class='c009'>No drones, whatever.</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle was going out sight-seeing with
me in a silk hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>I objected to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Plug hat doesn’t suit informal Chicago.</p>

<p class='c009'>He changed his frock-coat for a sack-coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Uncle, you look more like a Chicago
gentleman!” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, this is a plain sack-coat city.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was fussing with a handkerchief. I said,
laughing: “Never mind, Uncle! I am sure
the men don’t carry it here, since the women
never carry a purse in their hand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Isn’t it awful that one (even a stranger)
ought to know everything in Chicago? A
slight question to the street people would be
condemned as a nuisance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the policeman shows no chivalry.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was sorry that the colour of his suit was
bitterly faded.</p>

<p class='c009'>Isn’t Chicago rich enough to furnish a new
one?</p>

<p class='c009'>I suppose many dogs must be hanging around
here, because the policeman arms himself with
a piece of wood for chasing them off.</p>

<p class='c009'>I should like to know if there is any blacker
house than the City Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be a matter of a short time before the
Chicago River turns to ink.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then we went to observe the Lake of
Michigan from Lincoln Park.</p>

<p class='c009'>I scoffed at my absurdity in being ready
with the first line for my poem on the lake.
If you knew that “O minstrel of Heaven and
Truth!” was the beginning, you would laugh
surely. The lake wasn’t a huge singer like
the Pacific Ocean, at all.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>“Uncle, please, count how many stories in
that building!” I begged.</p>

<p class='c009'>Chicago structures “crush my little liver”
completely. Did I ever dream that I would
eye such pillars of the sky in my life?</p>

<p class='c009'>When I returned to my hotel, I declared
that I would not open my trunk, because my
everyday dress was good enough for Chicago.</p>

<p class='c009'>I regret to say that the gentlemen are so
homely.</p>
<p class='c014'>9th—How dear is the green crispy paper
money.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a historical look!</p>

<p class='c009'>It made me feel as if I were at home.</p>

<p class='c009'>I hated ever so much the gold coin in
California. Its threateningly mercantile aspect
made me shudder as at a speculator of
Kakigara Cho of Tokio.</p>

<p class='c009'>If I like Chicago it must be on account of
its soiled paper money.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will exchange all my gold to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I went to one store for a short skirt like
that Chicago woman wears.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may be a change, though shortness in
hair and dress is my aversion. It may be advantageous
in showing one’s shoes, though
eternal exhibition isn’t tasty.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be an accurate account of my reason
for buying to say that I singularly wished
to use up a few jumbles of money.</p>

<p class='c009'>I dulled myself reading the advertising bills
through my hotel window.</p>

<p class='c009'>There’s no block free from them.</p>

<p class='c009'>’Vertisement!</p>

<p class='c009'>Isn’t it horrid?</p>

<p class='c009'>I laughed, wondering why those enterprising
Meriken jins don’t employ the extensive
backs of prizefighters in the ring.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle and I went to see the Injuns dance.</p>

<p class='c009'>How fantastically they sang!</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a Japanese tea-house.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is no “tea-house” at all. It was the saddest
thing I ever saw.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought that Chicagoans were not fastidious
with anything.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Any old thing will do!” they might say
jollily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Open, hard-working Chicago!</p>

<p class='c009'>Has she much education?</p>
<p class='c014'>10th—My uncle wanted me to join him in
visiting a stockyard to see the doomed pigs
groaning, “Fu, fu, fu!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I declined.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle started off alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was some time before I heard someone
fisting on my door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A Japanese gentleman wishes to see your
husband, madam,” a hotel attendant addressed
me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good God! My husband?” I cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>Satemo!</p>

<p class='c009'>How could any porter be such an ignoramus
as not to distinguish between Mrs. and Miss!</p>

<p class='c009'>Possibly he esteemed me “modern” enough
to marry an old man for money’s sake.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oya, he was Mr. Consul of Chicago.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Walk in, sir! Uchino hito will return within
an hour or so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I explained about “my husband.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We both laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is nothing more pleasing when in an
alien country than a chit-chat in our native
“becha becha.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Japanese speech!</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a beautifully indefinite, poetically untidy
language!</p>

<p class='c009'>I love it.</p>
<p class='c014'>11th—It would be too much of a risk of one’s
life to stay in Chicago.</p>

<p class='c009'>Good-bye!</p>

<p class='c009'>Flowerless, birdless city, sayonara!</p>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Buffalo</span>, 12th</p>

<p class='c009'>Niagara Falls was a disappointment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle says I have still to learn how to be
appreciative of things.</p>

<p class='c009'>A red brick chimney by the Fall spoils the
whole affair, I do think.</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle was cross, saying that he had eaten
the toughest beef of his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>He seized two Canadian dimes and a bogus
half-dollar in an hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor Uncle! Isn’t this Buffalo town awful?”
I said.</p>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>New York</span>, 13th</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Morning Glory has stepped into
Greater New York, at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thirteenth of March, 1900.</p>

<p class='c009'>To-day will be the special day of my family
history.</p>

<p class='c009'>My entrance was delightful to the full.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train stole gracefully into the city at
early morn. The sky was distinct like the
lake of Biwa. The respectable face of the city
accepted us charmingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>I bounced my little body in my happy
thought of another chapter of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt like Dante crawled out of darkest
Hell, after the torture of the terrible show.
(O Chicago!)</p>

<p class='c009'>Our kind Japanese consul of New York was
looking after our arrival with a carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>I saw a horse-car trotting.</p>

<p class='c009'>It encouraged me to think that even an ignorant
Jap girl might find her own living here,
since such an old-fashioned thing exists perfectly.</p>

<p class='c009'>I secretly fixed in my mind that I will adventure
my independent life when the crisis
demands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our carriage rolled up Fifth Avenue to
Central Park.</p>

<p class='c009'>How often had I imagined laying me in this
celebrated ground!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray, let me off to smell the smell of the
New York breeze!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I was stationed on the third floor of
an edifice on Riverside Drive—what a brisk
name in the world!—which was Mr. Consul’s
home, my bubbling fancies hastened down
with the waters of the Hudson River under
my window.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hudson River?</p>

<p class='c009'>It is my dear old acquaintance, introduced
by the ever so pleasing Mr. Irving.</p>

<p class='c009'>See its classical profundity before my face!</p>

<p class='c009'>Where’s “Sleepy Hollow,” I wonder!</p>

<p class='c009'>The spectacle of the river reminded me of
the Sumida Gawa of Tokio, mirroring the
clouds of affectionate cherry blossoms which
border its bank. It would be a remarkable
idea, I thought, to petition the Mayor of New
York for the Japanese cherry-trees to parade
on this side of the Hudson. When they are
in flower, I will open a tea-house under them,
of course. My attire as a mistress should be
a little red crape apron to begin with. My
head will be wound with a Japanese towel to
endow my Oriental eyes with certain better
results. I will raise my voice, calling, “Honourable
rest! Honourable tea plucked by the
choicest musumes!” What a novel!</p>

<p class='c009'>Romance!</p>

<p class='c009'>How can I live without it!</p>

<p class='c009'>In that case I must entreat the removal of
the characters on the other side, which are:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lots For Sale!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Because I don’t see any such unaristocratic
sign by the Sumida Gawa.</p>
<p class='c014'>14th—O snow, yukiya fure, fure!</p>

<p class='c009'>The season of the city is still within the
fence of winter. I was grateful to my fate
that conveyed me here to overtake my loving
snow.</p>

<p class='c009'>I settled me by my window in absorption
with the snow view of Hudson Gawa.</p>

<p class='c009'>How busily the snowflakes fall!</p>

<p class='c009'>Their cautiously silent hurry made me
recollect the drama of the China-Japan war.
How stealthily the soldiers marched at midnight!
Can I ever forget how I tugged my
shoji, crying “Victory, Dai Nippon!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I raised the window, stretching out my arm.
I collected the snow-petals in the hollow of
my palm. I tasted them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle, New York snow is as deliciously
savoured as at home,” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Central Park must have been artistically
attired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oji San, let us go to the park for snow-viewing!
I advise you to till a bit more
poetry in yourself, Uncle,” I announced.</p>

<p class='c009'>I began to change my dress before his
decision.</p>
<p class='c014'>15th—We went to the famous Brooklyn
Bridge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Verily, New York gentlemen are interested
with their papers in the car. Newspapers,
O newspapers! There’s no slip of a doubt
that they would die without the sight of their
newspapers. The unheroic part about them
is that they forget neatly to offer their seats
to a lady. Woman loves an absent-minded
man once in a while, but never on the car, I
do say.</p>

<p class='c009'>I suppose every woman of this city has to
be rich.</p>

<p class='c009'>Must I equip a carriage?</p>

<p class='c009'>I do not see why I could not win the first
prize with my Louisiana ticket.</p>

<p class='c009'>How I wish to fabric an every-inch-a-Japanese
mansion on Fifth Avenue, and welcome
a thousand tojins to hear my Jap song on
Sunday!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is this bridge built for Americans or
Europeans, Uncle? People crossing here use
no English,” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Liberty Statue!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I will let the Beauty statue hail from the
Bay of Yedo, when I am wealthy enough to
afford it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Doesn’t Nippon signify beauty?</p>

<p class='c009'>“How dear is that sign, ‘Beware of Pick-pockets!’
It makes me just feel as if I were
at Shinbashi station in Tokio, doesn’t it you,
Uncle?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Humbly humble ’rikisha men!</p>

<p class='c009'>If I were besieged by them imploring me to
take a little honourable ride, the scene would
be complete.</p>

<p class='c009'>I miss such a merry car in Amerikey.</p>

<p class='c009'>We walked down Broadway. We came to
a graveyard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tombstones in the midst of commerce!</p>

<p class='c009'>O romantic New York!</p>

<p class='c009'>I wondered how Wall Street gentlemen
would be struck glancing at them.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a soft silence hovered!</p>

<p class='c009'>The old Gothic Church was my own ideal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle, let us fall in and rest!” I cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>The morning service was proceeding.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas and alas!</p>

<p class='c009'>Not one soul was there.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is this a religious city?</p>

<p class='c009'>The inside was compact of heavenly purple
air. Mr. Bishop—whatever he may be—gestured
like another being from a loftier realm.
A beautiful boy (there’s no greater fascination
than a boy with a prayer-book) supported the
service. Intangibleness of speech is itself a
divine charm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you mind asking Mr. Bishop whether
he wants a sweeping girl? I wish I were
given just a chance to clean such a holy church,
uncle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I looked up to Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p class='c014'>16th—It seems to me a recent style that
New York ladies discard their babies to leave
them in the hands of European immigrants
(very likely they want them to learn an ungrammatical
hodge-podge, as respectableness
is old-fashioned) and accompany a dog with
mighty affection.</p>

<p class='c009'>O my dear “chin” that I left at home!</p>

<p class='c009'>Shall I call it to Amerikey?</p>

<p class='c009'>Little loyal thing, pathetic, clinging!</p>

<p class='c009'>I am sure it would beat any other in a dog
contest.</p>
<p class='c014'>17th—I never saw such hungry eyes in my
life as those of an organ-grinder, set upon the
windows for a dropping penny.</p>

<p class='c009'>To an artist they would hint of a prisoner’s
bloodshot eyes numbed by useless gazing toward
the light of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Italians!</p>

<p class='c009'>They don’t know one thing but turning the
handle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last two days they placed their organ—read
their sign, “Garibaldi &amp; Co.”—under my
apartment at the same hour for my bit money.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought one of them might be a grandson
of the renowned Italian patriot. How interesting
it would be to be told of his shipwreck
in life!</p>

<p class='c009'>Now three o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>There’s one more hour before their frolic
music will gush.</p>

<p class='c009'>I must wrap some money in paper for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>God bless them—simple creatures who work
hard!</p>
<p class='c014'>18th—Mr. Consul—an old man who sips the
grayness of celibacy—never strays out from
his official duty. He calls society and novels
two recent pieces of foolery.</p>

<p class='c009'>The family of Uncle’s intimate is off in
Europe.</p>

<p class='c009'>The possibility of a nice time for me is verily
illegible. Tsumaranai!</p>

<p class='c009'>Last night I sketched an adventure of enlisting
in the band of domestics.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Capital idea to examine a New York
household!” I said, when I left my breakfast
table.</p>

<p class='c009'>I humbled myself to a newspaper office with
the following shamefaced advertisement:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jap girl, nineteen, good-looking, longs for
a place in a family of the first rank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I used every kind of oratory to bring my
uncle to agree to my two weeks of freedom.</p>
<p class='c014'>19th—Two letters were waiting me at the
office.</p>

<p class='c009'>One from No. 296 of a certain part.</p>

<p class='c009'>296?</p>

<p class='c009'>Unfortunately it sounds like “nikumu” in
Japanese, meaning hatred.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the other was from Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p class='c009'>Parlour maid.</p>

<p class='c009'>Twelve dollars for a month.</p>

<p class='c009'>I shall accept it, since it is the proper quarter
for seeing the high-toned New Yorker.</p>

<p class='c009'>I feel already a servant feeling.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am sorry that I didn’t discipline myself
before in dusting.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will style me an honest worker for awhile.
“Toiling for my daily bread,” does ring an
American sound, doesn’t it?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Domestic girl has no right, I think, to sit
with Messrs. Consul and Secretary,” I said,
moving my dinner plate to the kitchen table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Morning Glory, isn’t it time you changed
the book of your diary?</p>

<p class='c009'>Really, sir!</p>

<p class='c009'>Let me close now with a ceremonious bow!</p>

<p class='c009'>My next book shall be entitled:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
